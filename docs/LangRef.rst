Abstract
========

This document is a reference manual for the LLVM assembly language. LLVM
is a Static Single Assignment (SSA) based representation that provides
type safety, low-level operations, flexibility, and the capability of
representing 'all' high-level languages cleanly. It is the common code
representation used throughout all phases of the LLVM compilation
strategy.

Introduction
============

The LLVM code representation is designed to be used in three different
forms: as an in-memory compiler IR, as an on-disk bitcode representation
(suitable for fast loading by a Just-In-Time compiler), and as a human
readable assembly language representation. This allows LLVM to provide a
powerful intermediate representation for efficient compiler
transformations and analysis, while providing a natural means to debug
and visualize the transformations. The three different forms of LLVM are
all equivalent. This document describes the human readable
representation and notation.

The LLVM representation aims to be light-weight and low-level while
being expressive, typed, and extensible at the same time. It aims to be
a "universal IR" of sorts, by being at a low enough level that
high-level ideas may be cleanly mapped to it (similar to how
microprocessors are "universal IR's", allowing many source languages to
be mapped to them). By providing type information, LLVM can be used as
the target of optimizations: for example, through pointer analysis, it
can be proven that a C automatic variable is never accessed outside of
the current function, allowing it to be promoted to a simple SSA value
instead of a memory location.

.. _wellformed:

Well-Formedness
---------------

It is important to note that this document describes 'well formed' LLVM
assembly language. There is a difference between what the parser accepts
and what is considered 'well formed'. For example, the following
instruction is syntactically okay, but not well formed:

.. code-block:: llvm

    %x = add i32 1, %x

because the definition of ``%x`` does not dominate all of its uses. The
LLVM infrastructure provides a verification pass that may be used to
verify that an LLVM module is well formed. This pass is automatically
run by the parser after parsing input assembly and by the optimizer
before it outputs bitcode. The violations pointed out by the verifier
pass indicate bugs in transformation passes or input to the parser.

.. _identifiers:

Identifiers
===========

LLVM identifiers come in two basic types: global and local. Global
identifiers (functions, global variables) begin with the ``'@'``
character. Local identifiers (register names, types) begin with the
``'%'`` character. Additionally, there are three different formats for
identifiers, for different purposes:

#. Named values are represented as a string of characters with their
   prefix. For example, ``%foo``, ``@DivisionByZero``,
   ``%a.really.long.identifier``. The actual regular expression used is
   '``[%@][a-zA-Z$._][a-zA-Z$._0-9]*``'. Identifiers which require other
   characters in their names can be surrounded with quotes. Special
   characters may be escaped using ``"\xx"`` where ``xx`` is the ASCII
   code for the character in hexadecimal. In this way, any character can
   be used in a name value, even quotes themselves.
#. Unnamed values are represented as an unsigned numeric value with
   their prefix. For example, ``%12``, ``@2``, ``%44``.
#. Constants, which are described in the section  Constants_ below.

LLVM requires that values start with a prefix for two reasons: Compilers
don't need to worry about name clashes with reserved words, and the set
of reserved words may be expanded in the future without penalty.
Additionally, unnamed identifiers allow a compiler to quickly come up
with a temporary variable without having to avoid symbol table
conflicts.

Reserved words in LLVM are very similar to reserved words in other
languages. There are keywords for different opcodes ('``add``',
'``bitcast``', '``ret``', etc...), for primitive type names ('``void``',
'``i32``', etc...), and others. These reserved words cannot conflict
with variable names, because none of them start with a prefix character
(``'%'`` or ``'@'``).

Here is an example of LLVM code to multiply the integer variable
'``%X``' by 8:

The easy way:

.. code-block:: llvm

    %result = mul i32 %X, 8

After strength reduction:

.. code-block:: llvm

    %result = shl i32 %X, 3

And the hard way:

.. code-block:: llvm

    %0 = add i32 %X, %X           ; yields {i32}:%0
    %1 = add i32 %0, %0           ; yields {i32}:%1
    %result = add i32 %1, %1

This last way of multiplying ``%X`` by 8 illustrates several important
lexical features of LLVM:

#. Comments are delimited with a '``;``' and go until the end of line.
#. Unnamed temporaries are created when the result of a computation is
   not assigned to a named value.
#. Unnamed temporaries are numbered sequentially (using a per-function
   incrementing counter, starting with 0).

It also shows a convention that we follow in this document. When
demonstrating instructions, we will follow an instruction with a comment
that defines the type and name of value produced.

High Level Structure
====================

Module Structure
----------------

LLVM programs are composed of ``Module``'s, each of which is a
translation unit of the input programs. Each module consists of
functions, global variables, and symbol table entries. Modules may be
combined together with the LLVM linker, which merges function (and
global variable) definitions, resolves forward declarations, and merges
symbol table entries. Here is an example of the "hello world" module:

.. code-block:: llvm

    ; Declare the string constant as a global constant.
    @.str = private unnamed_addr constant [13 x i8] c"hello world\0A\00"

    ; External declaration of the puts function
    declare i32 @puts(i8* nocapture) nounwind

    ; Definition of main function
    define i32 @main() {   ; i32()*
      ; Convert [13 x i8]* to i8  *...
      %cast210 = getelementptr [13 x i8]* @.str, i64 0, i64 0

      ; Call puts function to write out the string to stdout.
      call i32 @puts(i8* %cast210)
      ret i32 0
    }

    ; Named metadata
    !1 = metadata !{i32 42}
    !foo = !{!1, null}

This example is made up of a :ref:`global variable <globalvars>` named
"``.str``", an external declaration of the "``puts``" function, a
:ref:`function definition <functionstructure>` for "``main``" and
:ref:`named metadata <namedmetadatastructure>` "``foo``".

In general, a module is made up of a list of global values (where both
functions and global variables are global values). Global values are
represented by a pointer to a memory location (in this case, a pointer
to an array of char, and a pointer to a function), and have one of the
following :ref:`linkage types <linkage>`.

.. _linkage:

Linkage Types
-------------

All Global Variables and Functions have one of the following types of
linkage:

``private``
    Global values with "``private``" linkage are only directly
    accessible by objects in the current module. In particular, linking
    code into a module with an private global value may cause the
    private to be renamed as necessary to avoid collisions. Because the
    symbol is private to the module, all references can be updated. This
    doesn't show up in any symbol table in the object file.
``linker_private``
    Similar to ``private``, but the symbol is passed through the
    assembler and evaluated by the linker. Unlike normal strong symbols,
    they are removed by the linker from the final linked image
    (executable or dynamic library).
``linker_private_weak``
    Similar to "``linker_private``", but the symbol is weak. Note that
    ``linker_private_weak`` symbols are subject to coalescing by the
    linker. The symbols are removed by the linker from the final linked
    image (executable or dynamic library).
``internal``
    Similar to private, but the value shows as a local symbol
    (``STB_LOCAL`` in the case of ELF) in the object file. This
    corresponds to the notion of the '``static``' keyword in C.
``available_externally``
    Globals with "``available_externally``" linkage are never emitted
    into the object file corresponding to the LLVM module. They exist to
    allow inlining and other optimizations to take place given knowledge
    of the definition of the global, which is known to be somewhere
    outside the module. Globals with ``available_externally`` linkage
    are allowed to be discarded at will, and are otherwise the same as
    ``linkonce_odr``. This linkage type is only allowed on definitions,
    not declarations.
``linkonce``
    Globals with "``linkonce``" linkage are merged with other globals of
    the same name when linkage occurs. This can be used to implement
    some forms of inline functions, templates, or other code which must
    be generated in each translation unit that uses it, but where the
    body may be overridden with a more definitive definition later.
    Unreferenced ``linkonce`` globals are allowed to be discarded. Note
    that ``linkonce`` linkage does not actually allow the optimizer to
    inline the body of this function into callers because it doesn't
    know if this definition of the function is the definitive definition
    within the program or whether it will be overridden by a stronger
    definition. To enable inlining and other optimizations, use
    "``linkonce_odr``" linkage.
``weak``
    "``weak``" linkage has the same merging semantics as ``linkonce``
    linkage, except that unreferenced globals with ``weak`` linkage may
    not be discarded. This is used for globals that are declared "weak"
    in C source code.
``common``
    "``common``" linkage is most similar to "``weak``" linkage, but they
    are used for tentative definitions in C, such as "``int X;``" at
    global scope. Symbols with "``common``" linkage are merged in the
    same way as ``weak symbols``, and they may not be deleted if
    unreferenced. ``common`` symbols may not have an explicit section,
    must have a zero initializer, and may not be marked
    ':ref:`constant <globalvars>`'. Functions and aliases may not have
    common linkage.

.. _linkage_appending:

``appending``
    "``appending``" linkage may only be applied to global variables of
    pointer to array type. When two global variables with appending
    linkage are linked together, the two global arrays are appended
    together. This is the LLVM, typesafe, equivalent of having the
    system linker append together "sections" with identical names when
    .o files are linked.
``extern_weak``
    The semantics of this linkage follow the ELF object file model: the
    symbol is weak until linked, if not linked, the symbol becomes null
    instead of being an undefined reference.
``linkonce_odr``, ``weak_odr``
    Some languages allow differing globals to be merged, such as two
    functions with different semantics. Other languages, such as
    ``C++``, ensure that only equivalent globals are ever merged (the
    "one definition rule" --- "ODR").  Such languages can use the
    ``linkonce_odr`` and ``weak_odr`` linkage types to indicate that the
    global will only be merged with equivalent globals. These linkage
    types are otherwise the same as their non-``odr`` versions.
``linkonce_odr_auto_hide``
    Similar to "``linkonce_odr``", but nothing in the translation unit
    takes the address of this definition. For instance, functions that
    had an inline definition, but the compiler decided not to inline it.
    ``linkonce_odr_auto_hide`` may have only ``default`` visibility. The
    symbols are removed by the linker from the final linked image
    (executable or dynamic library).
``external``
    If none of the above identifiers are used, the global is externally
    visible, meaning that it participates in linkage and can be used to
    resolve external symbol references.

The next two types of linkage are targeted for Microsoft Windows
platform only. They are designed to support importing (exporting)
symbols from (to) DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries).

``dllimport``
    "``dllimport``" linkage causes the compiler to reference a function
    or variable via a global pointer to a pointer that is set up by the
    DLL exporting the symbol. On Microsoft Windows targets, the pointer
    name is formed by combining ``__imp_`` and the function or variable
    name.
``dllexport``
    "``dllexport``" linkage causes the compiler to provide a global
    pointer to a pointer in a DLL, so that it can be referenced with the
    ``dllimport`` attribute. On Microsoft Windows targets, the pointer
    name is formed by combining ``__imp_`` and the function or variable
    name.

For example, since the "``.LC0``" variable is defined to be internal, if
another module defined a "``.LC0``" variable and was linked with this
one, one of the two would be renamed, preventing a collision. Since
"``main``" and "``puts``" are external (i.e., lacking any linkage
declarations), they are accessible outside of the current module.

It is illegal for a function *declaration* to have any linkage type
other than ``external``, ``dllimport`` or ``extern_weak``.

Aliases can have only ``external``, ``internal``, ``weak`` or
``weak_odr`` linkages.

.. _callingconv:

Calling Conventions
-------------------

LLVM :ref:`functions <functionstructure>`, :ref:`calls <i_call>` and
:ref:`invokes <i_invoke>` can all have an optional calling convention
specified for the call. The calling convention of any pair of dynamic
caller/callee must match, or the behavior of the program is undefined.
The following calling conventions are supported by LLVM, and more may be
added in the future:

"``ccc``" - The C calling convention
    This calling convention (the default if no other calling convention
    is specified) matches the target C calling conventions. This calling
    convention supports varargs function calls and tolerates some
    mismatch in the declared prototype and implemented declaration of
    the function (as does normal C).
"``fastcc``" - The fast calling convention
    This calling convention attempts to make calls as fast as possible
    (e.g. by passing things in registers). This calling convention
    allows the target to use whatever tricks it wants to produce fast
    code for the target, without having to conform to an externally
    specified ABI (Application Binary Interface). `Tail calls can only
    be optimized when this, the GHC or the HiPE convention is
    used. <CodeGenerator.html#id80>`_ This calling convention does not
    support varargs and requires the prototype of all callees to exactly
    match the prototype of the function definition.
"``coldcc``" - The cold calling convention
    This calling convention attempts to make code in the caller as
    efficient as possible under the assumption that the call is not
    commonly executed. As such, these calls often preserve all registers
    so that the call does not break any live ranges in the caller side.
    This calling convention does not support varargs and requires the
    prototype of all callees to exactly match the prototype of the
    function definition.
"``cc 10``" - GHC convention
    This calling convention has been implemented specifically for use by
    the `Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) <http://www.haskell.org/ghc>`_.
    It passes everything in registers, going to extremes to achieve this
    by disabling callee save registers. This calling convention should
    not be used lightly but only for specific situations such as an
    alternative to the *register pinning* performance technique often
    used when implementing functional programming languages. At the
    moment only X86 supports this convention and it has the following
    limitations:

    -  On *X86-32* only supports up to 4 bit type parameters. No
       floating point types are supported.
    -  On *X86-64* only supports up to 10 bit type parameters and 6
       floating point parameters.

    This calling convention supports `tail call
    optimization <CodeGenerator.html#id80>`_ but requires both the
    caller and callee are using it.
"``cc 11``" - The HiPE calling convention
    This calling convention has been implemented specifically for use by
    the `High-Performance Erlang
    (HiPE) <http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/hipe/>`_ compiler, *the*
    native code compiler of the `Ericsson's Open Source Erlang/OTP
    system <http://www.erlang.org/download.shtml>`_. It uses more
    registers for argument passing than the ordinary C calling
    convention and defines no callee-saved registers. The calling
    convention properly supports `tail call
    optimization <CodeGenerator.html#id80>`_ but requires that both the
    caller and the callee use it. It uses a *register pinning*
    mechanism, similar to GHC's convention, for keeping frequently
    accessed runtime components pinned to specific hardware registers.
    At the moment only X86 supports this convention (both 32 and 64
    bit).
"``cc <n>``" - Numbered convention
    Any calling convention may be specified by number, allowing
    target-specific calling conventions to be used. Target specific
    calling conventions start at 64.

More calling conventions can be added/defined on an as-needed basis, to
support Pascal conventions or any other well-known target-independent
convention.

.. _visibilitystyles:

Visibility Styles
-----------------

All Global Variables and Functions have one of the following visibility
styles:

"``default``" - Default style
    On targets that use the ELF object file format, default visibility
    means that the declaration is visible to other modules and, in
    shared libraries, means that the declared entity may be overridden.
    On Darwin, default visibility means that the declaration is visible
    to other modules. Default visibility corresponds to "external
    linkage" in the language.
"``hidden``" - Hidden style
    Two declarations of an object with hidden visibility refer to the
    same object if they are in the same shared object. Usually, hidden
    visibility indicates that the symbol will not be placed into the
    dynamic symbol table, so no other module (executable or shared
    library) can reference it directly.
"``protected``" - Protected style
    On ELF, protected visibility indicates that the symbol will be
    placed in the dynamic symbol table, but that references within the
    defining module will bind to the local symbol. That is, the symbol
    cannot be overridden by another module.

.. _namedtypes:

Named Types
-----------

LLVM IR allows you to specify name aliases for certain types. This can
make it easier to read the IR and make the IR more condensed
(particularly when recursive types are involved). An example of a name
specification is:

.. code-block:: llvm

    %mytype = type { %mytype*, i32 }

You may give a name to any :ref:`type <typesystem>` except
":ref:`void <t_void>`". Type name aliases may be used anywhere a type is
expected with the syntax "%mytype".

Note that type names are aliases for the structural type that they
indicate, and that you can therefore specify multiple names for the same
type. This often leads to confusing behavior when dumping out a .ll
file. Since LLVM IR uses structural typing, the name is not part of the
type. When printing out LLVM IR, the printer will pick *one name* to
render all types of a particular shape. This means that if you have code
where two different source types end up having the same LLVM type, that
the dumper will sometimes print the "wrong" or unexpected type. This is
an important design point and isn't going to change.

.. _globalvars:

Global Variables
----------------

Global variables define regions of memory allocated at compilation time
instead of run-time. Global variables may optionally be initialized, may
have an explicit section to be placed in, and may have an optional
explicit alignment specified.

A variable may be defined as ``thread_local``, which means that it will
not be shared by threads (each thread will have a separated copy of the
variable). Not all targets support thread-local variables. Optionally, a
TLS model may be specified:

``localdynamic``
    For variables that are only used within the current shared library.
``initialexec``
    For variables in modules that will not be loaded dynamically.
``localexec``
    For variables defined in the executable and only used within it.

The models correspond to the ELF TLS models; see `ELF Handling For
Thread-Local Storage <http://people.redhat.com/drepper/tls.pdf>`_ for
more information on under which circumstances the different models may
be used. The target may choose a different TLS model if the specified
model is not supported, or if a better choice of model can be made.

A variable may be defined as a global ``constant``, which indicates that
the contents of the variable will **never** be modified (enabling better
optimization, allowing the global data to be placed in the read-only
section of an executable, etc). Note that variables that need runtime
initialization cannot be marked ``constant`` as there is a store to the
variable.

LLVM explicitly allows *declarations* of global variables to be marked
constant, even if the final definition of the global is not. This
capability can be used to enable slightly better optimization of the
program, but requires the language definition to guarantee that
optimizations based on the 'constantness' are valid for the translation
units that do not include the definition.

As SSA values, global variables define pointer values that are in scope
(i.e. they dominate) all basic blocks in the program. Global variables
always define a pointer to their "content" type because they describe a
region of memory, and all memory objects in LLVM are accessed through
pointers.

Global variables can be marked with ``unnamed_addr`` which indicates
that the address is not significant, only the content. Constants marked
like this can be merged with other constants if they have the same
initializer. Note that a constant with significant address *can* be
merged with a ``unnamed_addr`` constant, the result being a constant
whose address is significant.

A global variable may be declared to reside in a target-specific
numbered address space. For targets that support them, address spaces
may affect how optimizations are performed and/or what target
instructions are used to access the variable. The default address space
is zero. The address space qualifier must precede any other attributes.

LLVM allows an explicit section to be specified for globals. If the
target supports it, it will emit globals to the section specified.

By default, global initializers are optimized by assuming that global
variables defined within the module are not modified from their
initial values before the start of the global initializer.  This is
true even for variables potentially accessible from outside the
module, including those with external linkage or appearing in
``@llvm.used``. This assumption may be suppressed by marking the
variable with ``externally_initialized``.

An explicit alignment may be specified for a global, which must be a
power of 2. If not present, or if the alignment is set to zero, the
alignment of the global is set by the target to whatever it feels
convenient. If an explicit alignment is specified, the global is forced
to have exactly that alignment. Targets and optimizers are not allowed
to over-align the global if the global has an assigned section. In this
case, the extra alignment could be observable: for example, code could
assume that the globals are densely packed in their section and try to
iterate over them as an array, alignment padding would break this
iteration.

For example, the following defines a global in a numbered address space
with an initializer, section, and alignment:

.. code-block:: llvm

    @G = addrspace(5) constant float 1.0, section "foo", align 4

The following example defines a thread-local global with the
``initialexec`` TLS model:

.. code-block:: llvm

    @G = thread_local(initialexec) global i32 0, align 4

.. _functionstructure:

Functions
---------

LLVM function definitions consist of the "``define``" keyword, an
optional :ref:`linkage type <linkage>`, an optional :ref:`visibility
style <visibility>`, an optional :ref:`calling convention <callingconv>`,
an optional ``unnamed_addr`` attribute, a return type, an optional
:ref:`parameter attribute <paramattrs>` for the return type, a function
name, a (possibly empty) argument list (each with optional :ref:`parameter
attributes <paramattrs>`), optional :ref:`function attributes <fnattrs>`,
an optional section, an optional alignment, an optional :ref:`garbage
collector name <gc>`, an opening curly brace, a list of basic blocks,
and a closing curly brace.

LLVM function declarations consist of the "``declare``" keyword, an
optional :ref:`linkage type <linkage>`, an optional :ref:`visibility
style <visibility>`, an optional :ref:`calling convention <callingconv>`,
an optional ``unnamed_addr`` attribute, a return type, an optional
:ref:`parameter attribute <paramattrs>` for the return type, a function
name, a possibly empty list of arguments, an optional alignment, and an
optional :ref:`garbage collector name <gc>`.

A function definition contains a list of basic blocks, forming the CFG
(Control Flow Graph) for the function. Each basic block may optionally
start with a label (giving the basic block a symbol table entry),
contains a list of instructions, and ends with a
:ref:`terminator <terminators>` instruction (such as a branch or function
return). If explicit label is not provided, a block is assigned an
implicit numbered label, using a next value from the same counter as used
for unnamed temporaries (:ref:`see above<identifiers>`). For example, if a
function entry block does not have explicit label, it will be assigned
label "%0", then first unnamed temporary in that block will be "%1", etc.

The first basic block in a function is special in two ways: it is
immediately executed on entrance to the function, and it is not allowed
to have predecessor basic blocks (i.e. there can not be any branches to
the entry block of a function). Because the block can have no
predecessors, it also cannot have any :ref:`PHI nodes <i_phi>`.

LLVM allows an explicit section to be specified for functions. If the
target supports it, it will emit functions to the section specified.

An explicit alignment may be specified for a function. If not present,
or if the alignment is set to zero, the alignment of the function is set
by the target to whatever it feels convenient. If an explicit alignment
is specified, the function is forced to have at least that much
alignment. All alignments must be a power of 2.

If the ``unnamed_addr`` attribute is given, the address is know to not
be significant and two identical functions can be merged.

Syntax::

    define [linkage] [visibility]
           [cconv] [ret attrs]
           <ResultType> @<FunctionName> ([argument list])
           [fn Attrs] [section "name"] [align N]
           [gc] { ... }

.. _langref_aliases:

Aliases
-------

Aliases act as "second name" for the aliasee value (which can be either
function, global variable, another alias or bitcast of global value).
Aliases may have an optional :ref:`linkage type <linkage>`, and an optional
:ref:`visibility style <visibility>`.

Syntax::

    @<Name> = alias [Linkage] [Visibility] <AliaseeTy> @<Aliasee>

.. _namedmetadatastructure:

Named Metadata
--------------

Named metadata is a collection of metadata. :ref:`Metadata
nodes <metadata>` (but not metadata strings) are the only valid
operands for a named metadata.

Syntax::

    ; Some unnamed metadata nodes, which are referenced by the named metadata.
    !0 = metadata !{metadata !"zero"}
    !1 = metadata !{metadata !"one"}
    !2 = metadata !{metadata !"two"}
    ; A named metadata.
    !name = !{!0, !1, !2}

.. _paramattrs:

Parameter Attributes
--------------------

The return type and each parameter of a function type may have a set of
*parameter attributes* associated with them. Parameter attributes are
used to communicate additional information about the result or
parameters of a function. Parameter attributes are considered to be part
of the function, not of the function type, so functions with different
parameter attributes can have the same function type.

Parameter attributes are simple keywords that follow the type specified.
If multiple parameter attributes are needed, they are space separated.
For example:

.. code-block:: llvm

    declare i32 @printf(i8* noalias nocapture, ...)
    declare i32 @atoi(i8 zeroext)
    declare signext i8 @returns_signed_char()

Note that any attributes for the function result (``nounwind``,
``readonly``) come immediately after the argument list.

Currently, only the following parameter attributes are defined:

``zeroext``
    This indicates to the code generator that the parameter or return
    value should be zero-extended to the extent required by the target's
    ABI (which is usually 32-bits, but is 8-bits for a i1 on x86-64) by
    the caller (for a parameter) or the callee (for a return value).
``signext``
    This indicates to the code generator that the parameter or return
    value should be sign-extended to the extent required by the target's
    ABI (which is usually 32-bits) by the caller (for a parameter) or
    the callee (for a return value).
``inreg``
    This indicates that this parameter or return value should be treated
    in a special target-dependent fashion during while emitting code for
    a function call or return (usually, by putting it in a register as
    opposed to memory, though some targets use it to distinguish between
    two different kinds of registers). Use of this attribute is
    target-specific.
``byval``
    This indicates that the pointer parameter should really be passed by
    value to the function. The attribute implies that a hidden copy of
    the pointee is made between the caller and the callee, so the callee
    is unable to modify the value in the caller. This attribute is only
    valid on LLVM pointer arguments. It is generally used to pass
    structs and arrays by value, but is also valid on pointers to
    scalars. The copy is considered to belong to the caller not the
    callee (for example, ``readonly`` functions should not write to
    ``byval`` parameters). This is not a valid attribute for return
    values.

    The byval attribute also supports specifying an alignment with the
    align attribute. It indicates the alignment of the stack slot to
    form and the known alignment of the pointer specified to the call
    site. If the alignment is not specified, then the code generator
    makes a target-specific assumption.

``sret``
    This indicates that the pointer parameter specifies the address of a
    structure that is the return value of the function in the source
    program. This pointer must be guaranteed by the caller to be valid:
    loads and stores to the structure may be assumed by the callee
    not to trap and to be properly aligned. This may only be applied to
    the first parameter. This is not a valid attribute for return
    values.
``noalias``
    This indicates that pointer values :ref:`based <pointeraliasing>` on
    the argument or return value do not alias pointer values which are
    not *based* on it, ignoring certain "irrelevant" dependencies. For a
    call to the parent function, dependencies between memory references
    from before or after the call and from those during the call are
    "irrelevant" to the ``noalias`` keyword for the arguments and return
    value used in that call. The caller shares the responsibility with
    the callee for ensuring that these requirements are met. For further
    details, please see the discussion of the NoAlias response in `alias
    analysis <AliasAnalysis.html#MustMayNo>`_.

    Note that this definition of ``noalias`` is intentionally similar
    to the definition of ``restrict`` in C99 for function arguments,
    though it is slightly weaker.

    For function return values, C99's ``restrict`` is not meaningful,
    while LLVM's ``noalias`` is.
``nocapture``
    This indicates that the callee does not make any copies of the
    pointer that outlive the callee itself. This is not a valid
    attribute for return values.

.. _nest:

``nest``
    This indicates that the pointer parameter can be excised using the
    :ref:`trampoline intrinsics <int_trampoline>`. This is not a valid
    attribute for return values and can only be applied to one parameter.

``returned``
    This indicates that the function always returns the argument as its return
    value. This is an optimization hint to the code generator when generating
    the caller, allowing tail call optimization and omission of register saves
    and restores in some cases; it is not checked or enforced when generating
    the callee. The parameter and the function return type must be valid
    operands for the :ref:`bitcast instruction <i_bitcast>`. This is not a
    valid attribute for return values and can only be applied to one parameter.

.. _gc:

Garbage Collector Names
-----------------------

Each function may specify a garbage collector name, which is simply a
string:

.. code-block:: llvm

    define void @f() gc "name" { ... }

The compiler declares the supported values of *name*. Specifying a
collector which will cause the compiler to alter its output in order to
support the named garbage collection algorithm.

.. _attrgrp:

Attribute Groups
----------------

Attribute groups are groups of attributes that are referenced by objects within
the IR. They are important for keeping ``.ll`` files readable, because a lot of
functions will use the same set of attributes. In the degenerative case of a
``.ll`` file that corresponds to a single ``.c`` file, the single attribute
group will capture the important command line flags used to build that file.

An attribute group is a module-level object. To use an attribute group, an
object references the attribute group's ID (e.g. ``#37``). An object may refer
to more than one attribute group. In that situation, the attributes from the
different groups are merged.

Here is an example of attribute groups for a function that should always be
inlined, has a stack alignment of 4, and which shouldn't use SSE instructions:

.. code-block:: llvm

   ; Target-independent attributes:
   attributes #0 = { alwaysinline alignstack=4 }

   ; Target-dependent attributes:
   attributes #1 = { "no-sse" }

   ; Function @f has attributes: alwaysinline, alignstack=4, and "no-sse".
   define void @f() #0 #1 { ... }

.. _fnattrs:

Function Attributes
-------------------

Function attributes are set to communicate additional information about
a function. Function attributes are considered to be part of the
function, not of the function type, so functions with different function
attributes can have the same function type.

Function attributes are simple keywords that follow the type specified.
If multiple attributes are needed, they are space separated. For
example:

.. code-block:: llvm

    define void @f() noinline { ... }
    define void @f() alwaysinline { ... }
    define void @f() alwaysinline optsize { ... }
    define void @f() optsize { ... }

``alignstack(<n>)``
    This attribute indicates that, when emitting the prologue and
    epilogue, the backend should forcibly align the stack pointer.
    Specify the desired alignment, which must be a power of two, in
    parentheses.
``alwaysinline``
    This attribute indicates that the inliner should attempt to inline
    this function into callers whenever possible, ignoring any active
    inlining size threshold for this caller.
``builtin``
    This indicates that the callee function at a call site should be
    recognized as a built-in function, even though the function's declaration
    uses the ``nobuiltin`` attribute. This is only valid at call sites for
    direct calls to functions which are declared with the ``nobuiltin``
    attribute.
``cold``
    This attribute indicates that this function is rarely called. When
    computing edge weights, basic blocks post-dominated by a cold
    function call are also considered to be cold; and, thus, given low
    weight.
``nonlazybind``
    This attribute suppresses lazy symbol binding for the function. This
    may make calls to the function faster, at the cost of extra program
    startup time if the function is not called during program startup.
``inlinehint``
    This attribute indicates that the source code contained a hint that
    inlining this function is desirable (such as the "inline" keyword in
    C/C++). It is just a hint; it imposes no requirements on the
    inliner.
``naked``
    This attribute disables prologue / epilogue emission for the
    function. This can have very system-specific consequences.
``nobuiltin``
    This indicates that the callee function at a call site is not recognized as
    a built-in function. LLVM will retain the original call and not replace it
    with equivalent code based on the semantics of the built-in function, unless
    the call site uses the ``builtin`` attribute. This is valid at call sites
    and on function declarations and definitions.
``noduplicate``
    This attribute indicates that calls to the function cannot be
    duplicated. A call to a ``noduplicate`` function may be moved
    within its parent function, but may not be duplicated within
    its parent function.

    A function containing a ``noduplicate`` call may still
    be an inlining candidate, provided that the call is not
    duplicated by inlining. That implies that the function has
    internal linkage and only has one call site, so the original
    call is dead after inlining.
``noimplicitfloat``
    This attributes disables implicit floating point instructions.
``noinline``
    This attribute indicates that the inliner should never inline this
    function in any situation. This attribute may not be used together
    with the ``alwaysinline`` attribute.
``noredzone``
    This attribute indicates that the code generator should not use a
    red zone, even if the target-specific ABI normally permits it.
``noreturn``
    This function attribute indicates that the function never returns
    normally. This produces undefined behavior at runtime if the
    function ever does dynamically return.
``nounwind``
    This function attribute indicates that the function never returns
    with an unwind or exceptional control flow. If the function does
    unwind, its runtime behavior is undefined.
``optsize``
    This attribute suggests that optimization passes and code generator
    passes make choices that keep the code size of this function low,
    and otherwise do optimizations specifically to reduce code size.
``readnone``
    On a function, this attribute indicates that the function computes its
    result (or decides to unwind an exception) based strictly on its arguments,
    without dereferencing any pointer arguments or otherwise accessing
    any mutable state (e.g. memory, control registers, etc) visible to
    caller functions. It does not write through any pointer arguments
    (including ``byval`` arguments) and never changes any state visible
    to callers. This means that it cannot unwind exceptions by calling
    the ``C++`` exception throwing methods.
    
    On an argument, this attribute indicates that the function does not
    dereference that pointer argument, even though it may read or write the
    memory that the pointer points to if accessed through other pointers.
``readonly``
    On a function, this attribute indicates that the function does not write
    through any pointer arguments (including ``byval`` arguments) or otherwise
    modify any state (e.g. memory, control registers, etc) visible to
    caller functions. It may dereference pointer arguments and read
    state that may be set in the caller. A readonly function always
    returns the same value (or unwinds an exception identically) when
    called with the same set of arguments and global state. It cannot
    unwind an exception by calling the ``C++`` exception throwing
    methods.
    
    On an argument, this attribute indicates that the function does not write
    through this pointer argument, even though it may write to the memory that
    the pointer points to.
``returns_twice``
    This attribute indicates that this function can return twice. The C
    ``setjmp`` is an example of such a function. The compiler disables
    some optimizations (like tail calls) in the caller of these
    functions.
``sanitize_address``
    This attribute indicates that AddressSanitizer checks
    (dynamic address safety analysis) are enabled for this function.
``sanitize_memory``
    This attribute indicates that MemorySanitizer checks (dynamic detection
    of accesses to uninitialized memory) are enabled for this function.
``sanitize_thread``
    This attribute indicates that ThreadSanitizer checks
    (dynamic thread safety analysis) are enabled for this function.
``ssp``
    This attribute indicates that the function should emit a stack
    smashing protector. It is in the form of a "canary" --- a random value
    placed on the stack before the local variables that's checked upon
    return from the function to see if it has been overwritten. A
    heuristic is used to determine if a function needs stack protectors
    or not. The heuristic used will enable protectors for functions with:

    - Character arrays larger than ``ssp-buffer-size`` (default 8).
    - Aggregates containing character arrays larger than ``ssp-buffer-size``.
    - Calls to alloca() with variable sizes or constant sizes greater than
      ``ssp-buffer-size``.

    If a function that has an ``ssp`` attribute is inlined into a
    function that doesn't have an ``ssp`` attribute, then the resulting
    function will have an ``ssp`` attribute.
``sspreq``
    This attribute indicates that the function should *always* emit a
    stack smashing protector. This overrides the ``ssp`` function
    attribute.

    If a function that has an ``sspreq`` attribute is inlined into a
    function that doesn't have an ``sspreq`` attribute or which has an
    ``ssp`` or ``sspstrong`` attribute, then the resulting function will have
    an ``sspreq`` attribute.
``sspstrong``
    This attribute indicates that the function should emit a stack smashing
    protector. This attribute causes a strong heuristic to be used when
    determining if a function needs stack protectors.  The strong heuristic
    will enable protectors for functions with:

    - Arrays of any size and type
    - Aggregates containing an array of any size and type.
    - Calls to alloca().
    - Local variables that have had their address taken.

    This overrides the ``ssp`` function attribute.

    If a function that has an ``sspstrong`` attribute is inlined into a
    function that doesn't have an ``sspstrong`` attribute, then the
    resulting function will have an ``sspstrong`` attribute.
``uwtable``
    This attribute indicates that the ABI being targeted requires that
    an unwind table entry be produce for this function even if we can
    show that no exceptions passes by it. This is normally the case for
    the ELF x86-64 abi, but it can be disabled for some compilation
    units.

.. _moduleasm:

Module-Level Inline Assembly
----------------------------

Modules may contain "module-level inline asm" blocks, which corresponds
to the GCC "file scope inline asm" blocks. These blocks are internally
concatenated by LLVM and treated as a single unit, but may be separated
in the ``.ll`` file if desired. The syntax is very simple:

.. code-block:: llvm

    module asm "inline asm code goes here"
    module asm "more can go here"

The strings can contain any character by escaping non-printable
characters. The escape sequence used is simply "\\xx" where "xx" is the
two digit hex code for the number.

The inline asm code is simply printed to the machine code .s file when
assembly code is generated.

.. _langref_datalayout:

Data Layout
-----------

A module may specify a target specific data layout string that specifies
how data is to be laid out in memory. The syntax for the data layout is
simply:

.. code-block:: llvm

    target datalayout = "layout specification"

The *layout specification* consists of a list of specifications
separated by the minus sign character ('-'). Each specification starts
with a letter and may include other information after the letter to
define some aspect of the data layout. The specifications accepted are
as follows:

``E``
    Specifies that the target lays out data in big-endian form. That is,
    the bits with the most significance have the lowest address
    location.
``e``
    Specifies that the target lays out data in little-endian form. That
    is, the bits with the least significance have the lowest address
    location.
``S<size>``
    Specifies the natural alignment of the stack in bits. Alignment
    promotion of stack variables is limited to the natural stack
    alignment to avoid dynamic stack realignment. The stack alignment
    must be a multiple of 8-bits. If omitted, the natural stack
    alignment defaults to "unspecified", which does not prevent any
    alignment promotions.
``p[n]:<size>:<abi>:<pref>``
    This specifies the *size* of a pointer and its ``<abi>`` and
    ``<pref>``\erred alignments for address space ``n``. All sizes are in
    bits. Specifying the ``<pref>`` alignment is optional. If omitted, the
    preceding ``:`` should be omitted too. The address space, ``n`` is
    optional, and if not specified, denotes the default address space 0.
    The value of ``n`` must be in the range [1,2^23).
``i<size>:<abi>:<pref>``
    This specifies the alignment for an integer type of a given bit
    ``<size>``. The value of ``<size>`` must be in the range [1,2^23).
``v<size>:<abi>:<pref>``
    This specifies the alignment for a vector type of a given bit
    ``<size>``.
``f<size>:<abi>:<pref>``
    This specifies the alignment for a floating point type of a given bit
    ``<size>``. Only values of ``<size>`` that are supported by the target
    will work. 32 (float) and 64 (double) are supported on all targets; 80
    or 128 (different flavors of long double) are also supported on some
    targets.
``a<size>:<abi>:<pref>``
    This specifies the alignment for an aggregate type of a given bit
    ``<size>``.
``s<size>:<abi>:<pref>``
    This specifies the alignment for a stack object of a given bit
    ``<size>``.
``n<size1>:<size2>:<size3>...``
    This specifies a set of native integer widths for the target CPU in
    bits. For example, it might contain ``n32`` for 32-bit PowerPC,
    ``n32:64`` for PowerPC 64, or ``n8:16:32:64`` for X86-64. Elements of
    this set are considered to support most general arithmetic operations
    efficiently.

When constructing the data layout for a given target, LLVM starts with a
default set of specifications which are then (possibly) overridden by
the specifications in the ``datalayout`` keyword. The default
specifications are given in this list:

-  ``E`` - big endian
-  ``p:64:64:64`` - 64-bit pointers with 64-bit alignment
-  ``S0`` - natural stack alignment is unspecified
-  ``i1:8:8`` - i1 is 8-bit (byte) aligned
-  ``i8:8:8`` - i8 is 8-bit (byte) aligned
-  ``i16:16:16`` - i16 is 16-bit aligned
-  ``i32:32:32`` - i32 is 32-bit aligned
-  ``i64:32:64`` - i64 has ABI alignment of 32-bits but preferred
   alignment of 64-bits
-  ``f16:16:16`` - half is 16-bit aligned
-  ``f32:32:32`` - float is 32-bit aligned
-  ``f64:64:64`` - double is 64-bit aligned
-  ``f128:128:128`` - quad is 128-bit aligned
-  ``v64:64:64`` - 64-bit vector is 64-bit aligned
-  ``v128:128:128`` - 128-bit vector is 128-bit aligned
-  ``a0:0:64`` - aggregates are 64-bit aligned

When LLVM is determining the alignment for a given type, it uses the
following rules:

#. If the type sought is an exact match for one of the specifications,
   that specification is used.
#. If no match is found, and the type sought is an integer type, then
   the smallest integer type that is larger than the bitwidth of the
   sought type is used. If none of the specifications are larger than
   the bitwidth then the largest integer type is used. For example,
   given the default specifications above, the i7 type will use the
   alignment of i8 (next largest) while both i65 and i256 will use the
   alignment of i64 (largest specified).
#. If no match is found, and the type sought is a vector type, then the
   largest vector type that is smaller than the sought vector type will
   be used as a fall back. This happens because <128 x double> can be
   implemented in terms of 64 <2 x double>, for example.

The function of the data layout string may not be what you expect.
Notably, this is not a specification from the frontend of what alignment
the code generator should use.

Instead, if specified, the target data layout is required to match what
the ultimate *code generator* expects. This string is used by the
mid-level optimizers to improve code, and this only works if it matches
what the ultimate code generator uses. If you would like to generate IR
that does not embed this target-specific detail into the IR, then you
don't have to specify the string. This will disable some optimizations
that require precise layout information, but this also prevents those
optimizations from introducing target specificity into the IR.

.. _pointeraliasing:

Pointer Aliasing Rules
----------------------

Any memory access must be done through a pointer value associated with
an address range of the memory access, otherwise the behavior is
undefined. Pointer values are associated with address ranges according
to the following rules:

-  A pointer value is associated with the addresses associated with any
   value it is *based* on.
-  An address of a global variable is associated with the address range
   of the variable's storage.
-  The result value of an allocation instruction is associated with the
   address range of the allocated storage.
-  A null pointer in the default address-space is associated with no
   address.
-  An integer constant other than zero or a pointer value returned from
   a function not defined within LLVM may be associated with address
   ranges allocated through mechanisms other than those provided by
   LLVM. Such ranges shall not overlap with any ranges of addresses
   allocated by mechanisms provided by LLVM.

A pointer value is *based* on another pointer value according to the
following rules:

-  A pointer value formed from a ``getelementptr`` operation is *based*
   on the first operand of the ``getelementptr``.
-  The result value of a ``bitcast`` is *based* on the operand of the
   ``bitcast``.
-  A pointer value formed by an ``inttoptr`` is *based* on all pointer
   values that contribute (directly or indirectly) to the computation of
   the pointer's value.
-  The "*based* on" relationship is transitive.

Note that this definition of *"based"* is intentionally similar to the
definition of *"based"* in C99, though it is slightly weaker.

LLVM IR does not associate types with memory. The result type of a
``load`` merely indicates the size and alignment of the memory from
which to load, as well as the interpretation of the value. The first
operand type of a ``store`` similarly only indicates the size and
alignment of the store.

Consequently, type-based alias analysis, aka TBAA, aka
``-fstrict-aliasing``, is not applicable to general unadorned LLVM IR.
:ref:`Metadata <metadata>` may be used to encode additional information
which specialized optimization passes may use to implement type-based
alias analysis.

.. _volatile:

Volatile Memory Accesses
------------------------

Certain memory accesses, such as :ref:`load <i_load>`'s,
:ref:`store <i_store>`'s, and :ref:`llvm.memcpy <int_memcpy>`'s may be
marked ``volatile``. The optimizers must not change the number of
volatile operations or change their order of execution relative to other
volatile operations. The optimizers *may* change the order of volatile
operations relative to non-volatile operations. This is not Java's
"volatile" and has no cross-thread synchronization behavior.

IR-level volatile loads and stores cannot safely be optimized into
llvm.memcpy or llvm.memmove intrinsics even when those intrinsics are
flagged volatile. Likewise, the backend should never split or merge
target-legal volatile load/store instructions.

.. admonition:: Rationale

 Platforms may rely on volatile loads and stores of natively supported
 data width to be executed as single instruction. For example, in C
 this holds for an l-value of volatile primitive type with native
 hardware support, but not necessarily for aggregate types. The
 frontend upholds these expectations, which are intentionally
 unspecified in the IR. The rules above ensure that IR transformation
 do not violate the frontend's contract with the language.

.. _memmodel:

Memory Model for Concurrent Operations
--------------------------------------

The LLVM IR does not define any way to start parallel threads of
execution or to register signal handlers. Nonetheless, there are
platform-specific ways to create them, and we define LLVM IR's behavior
in their presence. This model is inspired by the C++0x memory model.

For a more informal introduction to this model, see the :doc:`Atomics`.

We define a *happens-before* partial order as the least partial order
that

-  Is a superset of single-thread program order, and
-  When a *synchronizes-with* ``b``, includes an edge from ``a`` to
   ``b``. *Synchronizes-with* pairs are introduced by platform-specific
   techniques, like pthread locks, thread creation, thread joining,
   etc., and by atomic instructions. (See also :ref:`Atomic Memory Ordering
   Constraints <ordering>`).

Note that program order does not introduce *happens-before* edges
between a thread and signals executing inside that thread.

Every (defined) read operation (load instructions, memcpy, atomic
loads/read-modify-writes, etc.) R reads a series of bytes written by
(defined) write operations (store instructions, atomic
stores/read-modify-writes, memcpy, etc.). For the purposes of this
section, initialized globals are considered to have a write of the
initializer which is atomic and happens before any other read or write
of the memory in question. For each byte of a read R, R\ :sub:`byte`
may see any write to the same byte, except:

-  If write\ :sub:`1`  happens before write\ :sub:`2`, and
   write\ :sub:`2` happens before R\ :sub:`byte`, then
   R\ :sub:`byte` does not see write\ :sub:`1`.
-  If R\ :sub:`byte` happens before write\ :sub:`3`, then
   R\ :sub:`byte` does not see write\ :sub:`3`.

Given that definition, R\ :sub:`byte` is defined as follows:

-  If R is volatile, the result is target-dependent. (Volatile is
   supposed to give guarantees which can support ``sig_atomic_t`` in
   C/C++, and may be used for accesses to addresses which do not behave
   like normal memory. It does not generally provide cross-thread
   synchronization.)
-  Otherwise, if there is no write to the same byte that happens before
   R\ :sub:`byte`, R\ :sub:`byte` returns ``undef`` for that byte.
-  Otherwise, if R\ :sub:`byte` may see exactly one write,
   R\ :sub:`byte` returns the value written by that write.
-  Otherwise, if R is atomic, and all the writes R\ :sub:`byte` may
   see are atomic, it chooses one of the values written. See the :ref:`Atomic
   Memory Ordering Constraints <ordering>` section for additional
   constraints on how the choice is made.
-  Otherwise R\ :sub:`byte` returns ``undef``.

R returns the value composed of the series of bytes it read. This
implies that some bytes within the value may be ``undef`` **without**
the entire value being ``undef``. Note that this only defines the
semantics of the operation; it doesn't mean that targets will emit more
than one instruction to read the series of bytes.

Note that in cases where none of the atomic intrinsics are used, this
model places only one restriction on IR transformations on top of what
is required for single-threaded execution: introducing a store to a byte
which might not otherwise be stored is not allowed in general.
(Specifically, in the case where another thread might write to and read
from an address, introducing a store can change a load that may see
exactly one write into a load that may see multiple writes.)

.. _ordering:

Atomic Memory Ordering Constraints
----------------------------------

Atomic instructions (:ref:`cmpxchg <i_cmpxchg>`,
:ref:`atomicrmw <i_atomicrmw>`, :ref:`fence <i_fence>`,
:ref:`atomic load <i_load>`, and :ref:`atomic store <i_store>`) take
an ordering parameter that determines which other atomic instructions on
the same address they *synchronize with*. These semantics are borrowed
from Java and C++0x, but are somewhat more colloquial. If these
descriptions aren't precise enough, check those specs (see spec
references in the :doc:`atomics guide <Atomics>`).
:ref:`fence <i_fence>` instructions treat these orderings somewhat
differently since they don't take an address. See that instruction's
documentation for details.

For a simpler introduction to the ordering constraints, see the
:doc:`Atomics`.

``unordered``
    The set of values that can be read is governed by the happens-before
    partial order. A value cannot be read unless some operation wrote
    it. This is intended to provide a guarantee strong enough to model
    Java's non-volatile shared variables. This ordering cannot be
    specified for read-modify-write operations; it is not strong enough
    to make them atomic in any interesting way.
``monotonic``
    In addition to the guarantees of ``unordered``, there is a single
    total order for modifications by ``monotonic`` operations on each
    address. All modification orders must be compatible with the
    happens-before order. There is no guarantee that the modification
    orders can be combined to a global total order for the whole program
    (and this often will not be possible). The read in an atomic
    read-modify-write operation (:ref:`cmpxchg <i_cmpxchg>` and
    :ref:`atomicrmw <i_atomicrmw>`) reads the value in the modification
    order immediately before the value it writes. If one atomic read
    happens before another atomic read of the same address, the later
    read must see the same value or a later value in the address's
    modification order. This disallows reordering of ``monotonic`` (or
    stronger) operations on the same address. If an address is written
    ``monotonic``-ally by one thread, and other threads ``monotonic``-ally
    read that address repeatedly, the other threads must eventually see
    the write. This corresponds to the C++0x/C1x
    ``memory_order_relaxed``.
``acquire``
    In addition to the guarantees of ``monotonic``, a
    *synchronizes-with* edge may be formed with a ``release`` operation.
    This is intended to model C++'s ``memory_order_acquire``.
``release``
    In addition to the guarantees of ``monotonic``, if this operation
    writes a value which is subsequently read by an ``acquire``
    operation, it *synchronizes-with* that operation. (This isn't a
    complete description; see the C++0x definition of a release
    sequence.) This corresponds to the C++0x/C1x
    ``memory_order_release``.
``acq_rel`` (acquire+release)
    Acts as both an ``acquire`` and ``release`` operation on its
    address. This corresponds to the C++0x/C1x ``memory_order_acq_rel``.
``seq_cst`` (sequentially consistent)
    In addition to the guarantees of ``acq_rel`` (``acquire`` for an
    operation which only reads, ``release`` for an operation which only
    writes), there is a global total order on all
    sequentially-consistent operations on all addresses, which is
    consistent with the *happens-before* partial order and with the
    modification orders of all the affected addresses. Each
    sequentially-consistent read sees the last preceding write to the
    same address in this global order. This corresponds to the C++0x/C1x
    ``memory_order_seq_cst`` and Java volatile.

.. _singlethread:

If an atomic operation is marked ``singlethread``, it only *synchronizes
with* or participates in modification and seq\_cst total orderings with
other operations running in the same thread (for example, in signal
handlers).

.. _fastmath:

Fast-Math Flags
---------------

LLVM IR floating-point binary ops (:ref:`fadd <i_fadd>`,
:ref:`fsub <i_fsub>`, :ref:`fmul <i_fmul>`, :ref:`fdiv <i_fdiv>`,
:ref:`frem <i_frem>`) have the following flags that can set to enable
otherwise unsafe floating point operations

``nnan``
   No NaNs - Allow optimizations to assume the arguments and result are not
   NaN. Such optimizations are required to retain defined behavior over
   NaNs, but the value of the result is undefined.

``ninf``
   No Infs - Allow optimizations to assume the arguments and result are not
   +/-Inf. Such optimizations are required to retain defined behavior over
   +/-Inf, but the value of the result is undefined.

``nsz``
   No Signed Zeros - Allow optimizations to treat the sign of a zero
   argument or result as insignificant.

``arcp``
   Allow Reciprocal - Allow optimizations to use the reciprocal of an
   argument rather than perform division.

``fast``
   Fast - Allow algebraically equivalent transformations that may
   dramatically change results in floating point (e.g. reassociate). This
   flag implies all the others.

.. _typesystem:

Type System
===========

The LLVM type system is one of the most important features of the
intermediate representation. Being typed enables a number of
optimizations to be performed on the intermediate representation
directly, without having to do extra analyses on the side before the
transformation. A strong type system makes it easier to read the
generated code and enables novel analyses and transformations that are
not feasible to perform on normal three address code representations.

.. _typeclassifications:

Type Classifications
--------------------

The types fall into a few useful classifications:


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Classification
     - Types

   * - :ref:`integer <t_integer>`
     - ``i1``, ``i2``, ``i3``, ... ``i8``, ... ``i16``, ... ``i32``, ...

   * - :ref:`floating point <t_floating>`
     - ``half``, ``float``, ``double``, ``x86_fp80``, ``fp128``,
       ``ppc_fp128``


   * - first class

       .. _t_firstclass:

     - :ref:`integer <t_integer>`, :ref:`floating point <t_floating>`,
       :ref:`pointer <t_pointer>`, :ref:`vector <t_vector>`,
       :ref:`structure <t_struct>`, :ref:`array <t_array>`,
       :ref:`label <t_label>`, :ref:`metadata <t_metadata>`.

   * - :ref:`primitive <t_primitive>`
     - :ref:`label <t_label>`,

       :ref:`structure <t_struct>`,
       :ref:`vector <t_vector>`,
       :ref:`opaque <t_opaque>`.

The :ref:`first class <t_firstclass>` types are perhaps the most important.
Values of these types are the only ones which can be produced by
instructions.

.. _t_primitive:

Primitive Types

The primitive types are the fundamental building blocks of the LLVM
system.

.. _t_integer:

Integer Type

^^^^^^^^^^^

Overview:
"""""""""

The x86mmx type represents a value held in an MMX register on an x86
machine. The operations allowed on it are quite limited: parameters and
return values, load and store, and bitcast. User-specified MMX
instructions are represented as intrinsic or asm calls with arguments
and/or results of this type. There are no arrays, vectors or constants
of this type.

Syntax:

::

      metadata

.. _t_derived:

Derived Types
-------------

The real power in LLVM comes from the derived types in the system. This
is what allows a programmer to represent arrays, functions, pointers,
and other useful types. Each of these types contain one or more element
types which may be a primitive type, or another derived type. For
example, it is possible to have a two dimensional array, using an array
as the element type of another array.

.. _t_aggregate:

Aggregate Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Aggregate Types are a subset of derived types that can contain multiple
member types. :ref:`Arrays <t_array>` and :ref:`structs <t_struct>` are
aggregate types. :ref:`Vectors <t_vector>` are not considered to be
aggregate types.

.. _t_array:

Array Type
^^^^^^^^^^

Overview:
"""""""""

The array type is a very simple derived type that arranges elements
sequentially in memory. The array type requires a size (number of
elements) and an underlying data type.

Syntax:
"""""""

::

      [<# elements> x <elementtype>]

The number of elements is a constant integer value; ``elementtype`` may
be any type with a size.

Examples:
"""""""""

+------------------+--------------------------------------+
| ``[40 x i32]``   | Array of 40 32-bit integer values.   |
+------------------+--------------------------------------+
| ``[41 x i32]``   | Array of 41 32-bit integer values.   |
+------------------+--------------------------------------+
| ``[4 x i8]``     | Array of 4 8-bit integer values.     |
+------------------+--------------------------------------+

Here are some examples of multidimensional arrays:

+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| ``[3 x [4 x i32]]``         | 3x4 array of 32-bit integer values.                      |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| ``[12 x [10 x float]]``     | 12x10 array of single precision floating point values.   |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| ``[2 x [3 x [4 x i16]]]``   | 2x3x4 array of 16-bit integer values.                    |
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+

There is no restriction on indexing beyond the end of the array implied
by a static type (though there are restrictions on indexing beyond the
bounds of an allocated object in some cases). This means that
single-dimension 'variable sized array' addressing can be implemented in
LLVM with a zero length array type. An implementation of 'pascal style
arrays' in LLVM could use the type "``{ i32, [0 x float]}``", for
example.

.. _t_function:

Function Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Overview:
"""""""""

The function type can be thought of as a function signature. It consists
of a return type and a list of formal parameter types. The return type
of a function type is a first class type or a void type.

Syntax:
"""""""

::

      <returntype> (<parameter list>)

...where '``<parameter list>``' is a comma-separated list of type
specifiers. Optionally, the parameter list may include a type ``...``,
which indicates that the function takes a variable number of arguments.
Variable argument functions can access their arguments with the
:ref:`variable argument handling intrinsic <int_varargs>` functions.
'``<returntype>``' is any type except :ref:`label <t_label>`.

Examples:

+---------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. _t_struct:

Structure Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Overview:
"""""""""

The structure type is used to represent a collection of data members
together in memory. The elements of a structure may be any type that has
a size.

Structures in memory are accessed using '``load``' and '``store``' by
getting a pointer to a field with the '``getelementptr``' instruction.
Structures in registers are accessed using the '``extractvalue``' and
'``insertvalue``' instructions.

Structures may optionally be "packed" structures, which indicate that
the alignment of the struct is one byte, and that there is no padding
between the elements. In non-packed structs, padding between field types
is inserted as defined by the DataLayout string in the module, which is
required to match what the underlying code generator expects.

Structures can either be "literal" or "identified". A literal structure
is defined inline with other types (e.g. ``{i32, i32}*``) whereas
identified types are always defined at the top level with a name.
Literal types are uniqued by their contents and can never be recursive
or opaque since there is no way to write one. Identified types can be
recursive, can be opaqued, and are never uniqued.

Constants
=========

LLVM has several different basic types of constants. This section
describes them all and their syntax.

Simple Constants
----------------

**Boolean constants**
    The two strings '``true``' and '``false``' are both valid constants
    of the ``i1`` type.
**Integer constants**
    Standard integers (such as '4') are constants of the
    :ref:`integer <t_integer>` type. Negative numbers may be used with
    integer types.
**Floating point constants**
    Floating point constants use standard decimal notation (e.g.
    123.421), exponential notation (e.g. 1.23421e+2), or a more precise
    hexadecimal notation (see below). The assembler requires the exact
    decimal value of a floating-point constant. For example, the
    assembler accepts 1.25 but rejects 1.3 because 1.3 is a repeating
    decimal in binary. Floating point constants must have a :ref:`floating
    point <t_floating>` type.
**Null pointer constants**
    The identifier '``null``' is recognized as a null pointer constant
    and must be of :ref:`pointer type <t_pointer>`.

The one non-intuitive notation for constants is the hexadecimal form of
floating point constants. For example, the form
'``double    0x432ff973cafa8000``' is equivalent to (but harder to read
than) '``double 4.5e+15``'. The only time hexadecimal floating point
constants are required (and the only time that they are generated by the
disassembler) is when a floating point constant must be emitted but it
cannot be represented as a decimal floating point number in a reasonable
number of digits. For example, NaN's, infinities, and other special
values are represented in their IEEE hexadecimal format so that assembly
and disassembly do not cause any bits to change in the constants.

When using the hexadecimal form, constants of types half, float, and
double are represented using the 16-digit form shown above (which
matches the IEEE754 representation for double); half and float values
must, however, be exactly representable as IEEE 754 half and single
precision, respectively. Hexadecimal format is always used for long
double, and there are three forms of long double. The 80-bit format used
by x86 is represented as ``0xK`` followed by 20 hexadecimal digits. The
128-bit format used by PowerPC (two adjacent doubles) is represented by
``0xM`` followed by 32 hexadecimal digits. The IEEE 128-bit format is
represented by ``0xL`` followed by 32 hexadecimal digits. Long doubles
will only work if they match the long double format on your target.
The IEEE 16-bit format (half precision) is represented by ``0xH``
followed by 4 hexadecimal digits. All hexadecimal formats are big-endian
(sign bit at the left).

There are no constants of type x86mmx.

.. _complexconstants:

Complex Constants
-----------------

Complex constants are a (potentially recursive) combination of simple
constants and smaller complex constants.

**Structure constants**
    Structure constants are represented with notation similar to
    structure type definitions (a comma separated list of elements,
    surrounded by braces (``{}``)). For example:
    "``{ i32 4, float 17.0, i32* @G }``", where "``@G``" is declared as
    "``@G = external global i32``". Structure constants must have
    :ref:`structure type <t_struct>`, and the number and types of elements
    must match those specified by the type.
**Array constants**
    Array constants are represented with notation similar to array type
    definitions (a comma separated list of elements, surrounded by
    square brackets (``[]``)). For example:
    "``[ i32 42, i32 11, i32 74 ]``". Array constants must have
    :ref:`array type <t_array>`, and the number and types of elements must
    match those specified by the type.
**Vector constants**
    Vector constants are represented with notation similar to vector
    type definitions (a comma separated list of elements, surrounded by
    less-than/greater-than's (``<>``)). For example:
    "``< i32 42, i32 11, i32 74, i32 100 >``". Vector constants
    must have :ref:`vector type <t_vector>`, and the number and types of
    elements must match those specified by the type.
**Zero initialization**
    The string '``zeroinitializer``' can be used to zero initialize a
    value to zero of *any* type, including scalar and
    :ref:`aggregate <t_aggregate>` types. This is often used to avoid
    having to print large zero initializers (e.g. for large arrays) and
    is always exactly equivalent to using explicit zero initializers.
**Metadata node**
    A metadata node is a structure-like constant with :ref:`metadata
    type <t_metadata>`. For example:
    "``metadata !{ i32 0, metadata !"test" }``". Unlike other
    constants that are meant to be interpreted as part of the
    instruction stream, metadata is a place to attach additional
    information such as debug info.

Global Variable and Function Addresses
--------------------------------------

The addresses of :ref:`global variables <globalvars>` and
:ref:`functions <functionstructure>` are always implicitly valid
(link-time) constants. These constants are explicitly referenced when
the :ref:`identifier for the global <identifiers>` is used and always have
:ref:`pointer <t_pointer>` type. For example, the following is a legal LLVM
file:

.. code-block:: llvm

    @X = global i32 17
    @Y = global i32 42
    @Z = global [2 x i32*] [ i32* @X, i32* @Y ]

.. _undefvalues:

Undefined Values
----------------

The string '``undef``' can be used anywhere a constant is expected, and
indicates that the user of the value may receive an unspecified
bit-pattern. Undefined values may be of any type (other than '``label``'
or '``void``') and be used anywhere a constant is permitted.

Undefined values are useful because they indicate to the compiler that
the program is well defined no matter what value is used. This gives the
compiler more freedom to optimize. Here are some examples of
(potentially surprising) transformations that are valid (in pseudo IR):

.. code-block:: llvm

      %A = add %X, undef
      %B = sub %X, undef
      %C = xor %X, undef
    Safe:
      %A = undef
      %B = undef
      %C = undef

This is safe because all of the output bits are affected by the undef
bits. Any output bit can have a zero or one depending on the input bits.

.. code-block:: llvm

      %A = or %X, undef
      %B = and %X, undef
    Safe:
      %A = -1
      %B = 0
    Unsafe:
      %A = undef
      %B = undef

These logical operations have bits that are not always affected by the
input. For example, if ``%X`` has a zero bit, then the output of the
'``and``' operation will always be a zero for that bit, no matter what
the corresponding bit from the '``undef``' is. As such, it is unsafe to
optimize or assume that the result of the '``and``' is '``undef``'.
However, it is safe to assume that all bits of the '``undef``' could be
0, and optimize the '``and``' to 0. Likewise, it is safe to assume that
all the bits of the '``undef``' operand to the '``or``' could be set,
allowing the '``or``' to be folded to -1.

.. code-block:: llvm

      %A = select undef, %X, %Y
      %B = select undef, 42, %Y
      %C = select %X, %Y, undef
    Safe:
      %A = %X     (or %Y)
      %B = 42     (or %Y)
      %C = %Y
    Unsafe:
      %A = undef
      %B = undef
      %C = undef

This set of examples shows that undefined '``select``' (and conditional
branch) conditions can go *either way*, but they have to come from one
of the two operands. In the ``%A`` example, if ``%X`` and ``%Y`` were
both known to have a clear low bit, then ``%A`` would have to have a
cleared low bit. However, in the ``%C`` example, the optimizer is
allowed to assume that the '``undef``' operand could be the same as
``%Y``, allowing the whole '``select``' to be eliminated.

.. code-block:: llvm

      %A = xor undef, undef

      %B = undef
      %C = xor %B, %B

      %D = undef
      %E = icmp lt %D, 4
      %F = icmp gte %D, 4

    Safe:
      %A = undef
      %B = undef
      %C = undef
      %D = undef
      %E = undef
      %F = undef

This example points out that two '``undef``' operands are not
necessarily the same. This can be surprising to people (and also matches
C semantics) where they assume that "``X^X``" is always zero, even if
``X`` is undefined. This isn't true for a number of reasons, but the
short answer is that an '``undef``' "variable" can arbitrarily change
its value over its "live range". This is true because the variable
doesn't actually *have a live range*. Instead, the value is logically
read from arbitrary registers that happen to be around when needed, so
the value is not necessarily consistent over time. In fact, ``%A`` and
``%C`` need to have the same semantics or the core LLVM "replace all
uses with" concept would not hold.

.. code-block:: llvm

      %A = fdiv undef, %X
      %B = fdiv %X, undef
    Safe:
      %A = undef
    b: unreachable

These examples show the crucial difference between an *undefined value*
and *undefined behavior*. An undefined value (like '``undef``') is
allowed to have an arbitrary bit-pattern. This means that the ``%A``
operation can be constant folded to '``undef``', because the '``undef``'
could be an SNaN, and ``fdiv`` is not (currently) defined on SNaN's.
However, in the second example, we can make a more aggressive
assumption: because the ``undef`` is allowed to be an arbitrary value,
we are allowed to assume that it could be zero. Since a divide by zero
has *undefined behavior*, we are allowed to assume that the operation
does not execute at all. This allows us to delete the divide and all
code after it. Because the undefined operation "can't happen", the
optimizer can assume that it occurs in dead code.

.. code-block:: llvm

    a:  store undef -> %X
    b:  store %X -> undef
    Safe:
    a: <deleted>
    b: unreachable

These examples reiterate the ``fdiv`` example: a store *of* an undefined
value can be assumed to not have any effect; we can assume that the
value is overwritten with bits that happen to match what was already
there. However, a store *to* an undefined location could clobber
arbitrary memory, therefore, it has undefined behavior.

.. _poisonvalues:

Poison Values
-------------

Poison values are similar to :ref:`undef values <undefvalues>`, however
they also represent the fact that an instruction or constant expression
which cannot evoke side effects has nevertheless detected a condition
which results in undefined behavior.

There is currently no way of representing a poison value in the IR; they
only exist when produced by operations such as :ref:`add <i_add>` with
the ``nsw`` flag.

Poison value behavior is defined in terms of value *dependence*:

-  Values other than :ref:`phi <i_phi>` nodes depend on their operands.
-  :ref:`Phi <i_phi>` nodes depend on the operand corresponding to
   their dynamic predecessor basic block.
-  Function arguments depend on the corresponding actual argument values
   in the dynamic callers of their functions.
-  :ref:`Call <i_call>` instructions depend on the :ref:`ret <i_ret>`
   instructions that dynamically transfer control back to them.
-  :ref:`Invoke <i_invoke>` instructions depend on the
   :ref:`ret <i_ret>`, :ref:`resume <i_resume>`, or exception-throwing
   call instructions that dynamically transfer control back to them.
-  Non-volatile loads and stores depend on the most recent stores to all
   of the referenced memory addresses, following the order in the IR
   (including loads and stores implied by intrinsics such as
   :ref:`@llvm.memcpy <int_memcpy>`.)
-  An instruction with externally visible side effects depends on the
   most recent preceding instruction with externally visible side
   effects, following the order in the IR. (This includes :ref:`volatile
   operations <volatile>`.)
-  An instruction *control-depends* on a :ref:`terminator
   instruction <terminators>` if the terminator instruction has
   multiple successors and the instruction is always executed when
   control transfers to one of the successors, and may not be executed
   when control is transferred to another.
-  Additionally, an instruction also *control-depends* on a terminator
   instruction if the set of instructions it otherwise depends on would
   be different if the terminator had transferred control to a different
   successor.
-  Dependence is transitive.

Poison Values have the same behavior as :ref:`undef values <undefvalues>`,
with the additional affect that any instruction which has a *dependence*
on a poison value has undefined behavior.

Here are some examples:

.. code-block:: llvm

    entry:
      %poison = sub nuw i32 0, 1           ; Results in a poison value.
      %still_poison = and i32 %poison, 0   ; 0, but also poison.
      %poison_yet_again = getelementptr i32* @h, i32 %still_poison
      store i32 0, i32* %poison_yet_again  ; memory at @h[0] is poisoned

      store i32 %poison, i32* @g           ; Poison value stored to memory.
      %poison2 = load i32* @g              ; Poison value loaded back from memory.

      store volatile i32 %poison, i32* @g  ; External observation; undefined behavior.

      %narrowaddr = bitcast i32* @g to i16*
      %wideaddr = bitcast i32* @g to i64*
      %poison3 = load i16* %narrowaddr     ; Returns a poison value.
      %poison4 = load i64* %wideaddr       ; Returns a poison value.

      %cmp = icmp slt i32 %poison, 0       ; Returns a poison value.
      br i1 %cmp, label %true, label %end  ; Branch to either destination.

    true:
      store volatile i32 0, i32* @g        ; This is control-dependent on %cmp, so
                                           ; it has undefined behavior.
      br label %end

    end:
      %p = phi i32 [ 0, %entry ], [ 1, %true ]
                                           ; Both edges into this PHI are
                                           ; control-dependent on %cmp, so this
                                           ; always results in a poison value.

      store volatile i32 0, i32* @g        ; This would depend on the store in %true
                                           ; if %cmp is true, or the store in %entry
                                           ; otherwise, so this is undefined behavior.

      br i1 %cmp, label %second_true, label %second_end
                                           ; The same branch again, but this time the
                                           ; true block doesn't have side effects.

    second_true:
      ; No side effects!
      ret void

    second_end:
      store volatile i32 0, i32* @g        ; This time, the instruction always depends
                                           ; on the store in %end. Also, it is
                                           ; control-equivalent to %end, so this is
                                           ; well-defined (ignoring earlier undefined
                                           ; behavior in this example).

.. _blockaddress:

Addresses of Basic Blocks
-------------------------

``blockaddress(@function, %block)``

The '``blockaddress``' constant computes the address of the specified
basic block in the specified function, and always has an ``i8*`` type.
Taking the address of the entry block is illegal.

This value only has defined behavior when used as an operand to the
':ref:`indirectbr <i_indirectbr>`' instruction, or for comparisons
against null. Pointer equality tests between labels addresses results in
undefined behavior --- though, again, comparison against null is ok, and
no label is equal to the null pointer. This may be passed around as an
opaque pointer sized value as long as the bits are not inspected. This
allows ``ptrtoint`` and arithmetic to be performed on these values so
long as the original value is reconstituted before the ``indirectbr``
instruction.

Finally, some targets may provide defined semantics when using the value
as the operand to an inline assembly, but that is target specific.

.. _constantexprs:

Constant Expressions
--------------------

Constant expressions are used to allow expressions involving other
constants to be used as constants. Constant expressions may be of any
:ref:`first class <t_firstclass>` type and may involve any LLVM operation
that does not have side effects (e.g. load and call are not supported).
The following is the syntax for constant expressions:

``trunc (CST to TYPE)``
    Truncate a constant to another type. The bit size of CST must be
    larger than the bit size of TYPE. Both types must be integers.
``zext (CST to TYPE)``
    Zero extend a constant to another type. The bit size of CST must be
    smaller than the bit size of TYPE. Both types must be integers.
``sext (CST to TYPE)``
    Sign extend a constant to another type. The bit size of CST must be
    smaller than the bit size of TYPE. Both types must be integers.
``fptrunc (CST to TYPE)``
    Truncate a floating point constant to another floating point type.
    The size of CST must be larger than the size of TYPE. Both types
    must be floating point.
``fpext (CST to TYPE)``
    Floating point extend a constant to another type. The size of CST
    must be smaller or equal to the size of TYPE. Both types must be
    floating point.
``fptoui (CST to TYPE)``
    Convert a floating point constant to the corresponding unsigned
    integer constant. TYPE must be a scalar or vector integer type. CST
    must be of scalar or vector floating point type. Both CST and TYPE
    must be scalars, or vectors of the same number of elements. If the
    value won't fit in the integer type, the results are undefined.
``fptosi (CST to TYPE)``
    Convert a floating point constant to the corresponding signed
    integer constant. TYPE must be a scalar or vector integer type. CST
    must be of scalar or vector floating point type. Both CST and TYPE
    must be scalars, or vectors of the same number of elements. If the
    value won't fit in the integer type, the results are undefined.
``uitofp (CST to TYPE)``
    Convert an unsigned integer constant to the corresponding floating
    point constant. TYPE must be a scalar or vector floating point type.
    CST must be of scalar or vector integer type. Both CST and TYPE must
    be scalars, or vectors of the same number of elements. If the value
    won't fit in the floating point type, the results are undefined.
``sitofp (CST to TYPE)``
    Convert a signed integer constant to the corresponding floating
    point constant. TYPE must be a scalar or vector floating point type.
    CST must be of scalar or vector integer type. Both CST and TYPE must
    be scalars, or vectors of the same number of elements. If the value
    won't fit in the floating point type, the results are undefined.
``ptrtoint (CST to TYPE)``
    Convert a pointer typed constant to the corresponding integer
    constant. ``TYPE`` must be an integer type. ``CST`` must be of
    pointer type. The ``CST`` value is zero extended, truncated, or
    unchanged to make it fit in ``TYPE``.
``inttoptr (CST to TYPE)``
    Convert an integer constant to a pointer constant. TYPE must be a
    pointer type. CST must be of integer type. The CST value is zero
    extended, truncated, or unchanged to make it fit in a pointer size.
    This one is *really* dangerous!
``bitcast (CST to TYPE)``
    Convert a constant, CST, to another TYPE. The constraints of the
    operands are the same as those for the :ref:`bitcast
    instruction <i_bitcast>`.
``getelementptr (CSTPTR, IDX0, IDX1, ...)``, ``getelementptr inbounds (CSTPTR, IDX0, IDX1, ...)``
    Perform the :ref:`getelementptr operation <i_getelementptr>` on
    constants. As with the :ref:`getelementptr <i_getelementptr>`
    instruction, the index list may have zero or more indexes, which are
    required to make sense for the type of "CSTPTR".
``select (COND, VAL1, VAL2)``
    Perform the :ref:`select operation <i_select>` on constants.
``icmp COND (VAL1, VAL2)``
    Performs the :ref:`icmp operation <i_icmp>` on constants.
``fcmp COND (VAL1, VAL2)``
    Performs the :ref:`fcmp operation <i_fcmp>` on constants.
``extractelement (VAL, IDX)``
    Perform the :ref:`extractelement operation <i_extractelement>` on
    constants.
``insertelement (VAL, ELT, IDX)``
    Perform the :ref:`insertelement operation <i_insertelement>` on
    constants.
``shufflevector (VEC1, VEC2, IDXMASK)``
    Perform the :ref:`shufflevector operation <i_shufflevector>` on
    constants.
``extractvalue (VAL, IDX0, IDX1, ...)``
    Perform the :ref:`extractvalue operation <i_extractvalue>` on
    constants. The index list is interpreted in a similar manner as
    indices in a ':ref:`getelementptr <i_getelementptr>`' operation. At
    least one index value must be specified.
``insertvalue (VAL, ELT, IDX0, IDX1, ...)``
    Perform the :ref:`insertvalue operation <i_insertvalue>` on constants.
    The index list is interpreted in a similar manner as indices in a
    ':ref:`getelementptr <i_getelementptr>`' operation. At least one index
    value must be specified.
``OPCODE (LHS, RHS)``
    Perform the specified operation of the LHS and RHS constants. OPCODE
    may be any of the :ref:`binary <binaryops>` or :ref:`bitwise
    binary <bitwiseops>` operations. The constraints on operands are
    the same as those for the corresponding instruction (e.g. no bitwise
    operations on floating point values are allowed).

Other Values
============

.. _inlineasmexprs:

Inline Assembler Expressions
----------------------------

LLVM supports inline assembler expressions (as opposed to :ref:`Module-Level
Inline Assembly <moduleasm>`) through the use of a special value. This
value represents the inline assembler as a string (containing the
instructions to emit), a list of operand constraints (stored as a
string), a flag that indicates whether or not the inline asm expression
has side effects, and a flag indicating whether the function containing
the asm needs to align its stack conservatively. An example inline
assembler expression is:

.. code-block:: llvm

    i32 (i32) asm "bswap $0", "=r,r"

Inline assembler expressions may **only** be used as the callee operand
of a :ref:`call <i_call>` or an :ref:`invoke <i_invoke>` instruction.
Thus, typically we have:

.. code-block:: llvm

    %X = call i32 asm "bswap $0", "=r,r"(i32 %Y)

Inline asms with side effects not visible in the constraint list must be
marked as having side effects. This is done through the use of the
'``sideeffect``' keyword, like so:

.. code-block:: llvm

    call void asm sideeffect "eieio", ""()

In some cases inline asms will contain code that will not work unless
the stack is aligned in some way, such as calls or SSE instructions on
x86, yet will not contain code that does that alignment within the asm.
The compiler should make conservative assumptions about what the asm
might contain and should generate its usual stack alignment code in the
prologue if the '``alignstack``' keyword is present:

.. code-block:: llvm

    call void asm alignstack "eieio", ""()

Inline asms also support using non-standard assembly dialects. The
assumed dialect is ATT. When the '``inteldialect``' keyword is present,
the inline asm is using the Intel dialect. Currently, ATT and Intel are
the only supported dialects. An example is:

.. code-block:: llvm

    call void asm inteldialect "eieio", ""()

If multiple keywords appear the '``sideeffect``' keyword must come
first, the '``alignstack``' keyword second and the '``inteldialect``'
keyword last.

Inline Asm Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The call instructions that wrap inline asm nodes may have a
"``!srcloc``" MDNode attached to it that contains a list of constant
integers. If present, the code generator will use the integer as the
location cookie value when report errors through the ``LLVMContext``
error reporting mechanisms. This allows a front-end to correlate backend
errors that occur with inline asm back to the source code that produced
it. For example:

.. code-block:: llvm

    call void asm sideeffect "something bad", ""(), !srcloc !42
    ...
    !42 = !{ i32 1234567 }

It is up to the front-end to make sense of the magic numbers it places
in the IR. If the MDNode contains multiple constants, the code generator
will use the one that corresponds to the line of the asm that the error
occurs on.

.. _metadata:

Metadata Nodes and Metadata Strings
-----------------------------------

LLVM IR allows metadata to be attached to instructions in the program
that can convey extra information about the code to the optimizers and
code generator. One example application of metadata is source-level
debug information. There are two metadata primitives: strings and nodes.
All metadata has the ``metadata`` type and is identified in syntax by a
preceding exclamation point ('``!``').

A metadata string is a string surrounded by double quotes. It can
contain any character by escaping non-printable characters with
"``\xx``" where "``xx``" is the two digit hex code. For example:
"``!"test\00"``".

Metadata nodes are represented with notation similar to structure
constants (a comma separated list of elements, surrounded by braces and
preceded by an exclamation point). Metadata nodes can have any values as
their operand. For example:

.. code-block:: llvm

    !{ metadata !"test\00", i32 10}

A :ref:`named metadata <namedmetadatastructure>` is a collection of
metadata nodes, which can be looked up in the module symbol table. For
example:

.. code-block:: llvm

    !foo =  metadata !{!4, !3}

Metadata can be used as function arguments. Here ``llvm.dbg.value``
function is using two metadata arguments:

.. code-block:: llvm

    call void @llvm.dbg.value(metadata !24, i64 0, metadata !25)

Metadata can be attached with an instruction. Here metadata ``!21`` is
attached to the ``add`` instruction using the ``!dbg`` identifier:

.. code-block:: llvm

    %indvar.next = add i64 %indvar, 1, !dbg !21

More information about specific metadata nodes recognized by the
optimizers and code generator is found below.

'``tbaa``' Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In LLVM IR, memory does not have types, so LLVM's own type system is not
suitable for doing TBAA. Instead, metadata is added to the IR to
describe a type system of a higher level language. This can be used to
implement typical C/C++ TBAA, but it can also be used to implement
custom alias analysis behavior for other languages.

The current metadata format is very simple. TBAA metadata nodes have up
to three fields, e.g.:

.. code-block:: llvm

    !0 = metadata !{ metadata !"an example type tree" }
    !1 = metadata !{ metadata !"int", metadata !0 }
    !2 = metadata !{ metadata !"float", metadata !0 }
    !3 = metadata !{ metadata !"const float", metadata !2, i64 1 }

The first field is an identity field. It can be any value, usually a
metadata string, which uniquely identifies the type. The most important
name in the tree is the name of the root node. Two trees with different
root node names are entirely disjoint, even if they have leaves with
common names.

The second field identifies the type's parent node in the tree, or is
null or omitted for a root node. A type is considered to alias all of
its descendants and all of its ancestors in the tree. Also, a type is
considered to alias all types in other trees, so that bitcode produced
from multiple front-ends is handled conservatively.

If the third field is present, it's an integer which if equal to 1
indicates that the type is "constant" (meaning
``pointsToConstantMemory`` should return true; see `other useful
AliasAnalysis methods <AliasAnalysis.html#OtherItfs>`_).

'``tbaa.struct``' Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :ref:`llvm.memcpy <int_memcpy>` is often used to implement
aggregate assignment operations in C and similar languages, however it
is defined to copy a contiguous region of memory, which is more than
strictly necessary for aggregate types which contain holes due to
padding. Also, it doesn't contain any TBAA information about the fields
of the aggregate.

``!tbaa.struct`` metadata can describe which memory subregions in a
memcpy are padding and what the TBAA tags of the struct are.

The current metadata format is very simple. ``!tbaa.struct`` metadata
nodes are a list of operands which are in conceptual groups of three.
For each group of three, the first operand gives the byte offset of a
field in bytes, the second gives its size in bytes, and the third gives
its tbaa tag. e.g.:

.. code-block:: llvm

    !4 = metadata !{ i64 0, i64 4, metadata !1, i64 8, i64 4, metadata !2 }

This describes a struct with two fields. The first is at offset 0 bytes
with size 4 bytes, and has tbaa tag !1. The second is at offset 8 bytes
and has size 4 bytes and has tbaa tag !2.

Note that the fields need not be contiguous. In this example, there is a
4 byte gap between the two fields. This gap represents padding which
does not carry useful data and need not be preserved.

'``fpmath``' Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``fpmath`` metadata may be attached to any instruction of floating point
type. It can be used to express the maximum acceptable error in the
result of that instruction, in ULPs, thus potentially allowing the
compiler to use a more efficient but less accurate method of computing
it. ULP is defined as follows:

    If ``x`` is a real number that lies between two finite consecutive
    floating-point numbers ``a`` and ``b``, without being equal to one
    of them, then ``ulp(x) = |b - a|``, otherwise ``ulp(x)`` is the
    distance between the two non-equal finite floating-point numbers
    nearest ``x``. Moreover, ``ulp(NaN)`` is ``NaN``.

The metadata node shall consist of a single positive floating point
number representing the maximum relative error, for example:

.. code-block:: llvm

    !0 = metadata !{ float 2.5 } ; maximum acceptable inaccuracy is 2.5 ULPs

'``range``' Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``range`` metadata may be attached only to loads of integer types. It
expresses the possible ranges the loaded value is in. The ranges are
represented with a flattened list of integers. The loaded value is known
to be in the union of the ranges defined by each consecutive pair. Each
pair has the following properties:

-  The type must match the type loaded by the instruction.
-  The pair ``a,b`` represents the range ``[a,b)``.
-  Both ``a`` and ``b`` are constants.
-  The range is allowed to wrap.
-  The range should not represent the full or empty set. That is,
   ``a!=b``.

In addition, the pairs must be in signed order of the lower bound and
they must be non-contiguous.

Examples:

.. code-block:: llvm

      %a = load i8* %x, align 1, !range !0 ; Can only be 0 or 1
      %b = load i8* %y, align 1, !range !1 ; Can only be 255 (-1), 0 or 1
      %c = load i8* %z, align 1, !range !2 ; Can only be 0, 1, 3, 4 or 5
      %d = load i8* %z, align 1, !range !3 ; Can only be -2, -1, 3, 4 or 5
    ...
    !0 = metadata !{ i8 0, i8 2 }
    !1 = metadata !{ i8 255, i8 2 }
    !2 = metadata !{ i8 0, i8 2, i8 3, i8 6 }
    !3 = metadata !{ i8 -2, i8 0, i8 3, i8 6 }

'``llvm.loop``'
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is sometimes useful to attach information to loop constructs. Currently,
loop metadata is implemented as metadata attached to the branch instruction
in the loop latch block. This type of metadata refer to a metadata node that is
guaranteed to be separate for each loop. The loop identifier metadata is 
specified with the name ``llvm.loop``.

The loop identifier metadata is implemented using a metadata that refers to
itself to avoid merging it with any other identifier metadata, e.g.,
during module linkage or function inlining. That is, each loop should refer
to their own identification metadata even if they reside in separate functions.
The following example contains loop identifier metadata for two separate loop
constructs:

.. code-block:: llvm

    !0 = metadata !{ metadata !0 }
    !1 = metadata !{ metadata !1 }

The loop identifier metadata can be used to specify additional per-loop
metadata. Any operands after the first operand can be treated as user-defined
metadata. For example the ``llvm.vectorizer.unroll`` metadata is understood
by the loop vectorizer to indicate how many times to unroll the loop:

.. code-block:: llvm

      br i1 %exitcond, label %._crit_edge, label %.lr.ph, !llvm.loop !0
    ...
    !0 = metadata !{ metadata !0, metadata !1 }
    !1 = metadata !{ metadata !"llvm.vectorizer.unroll", i32 2 }

'``llvm.mem``'
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Metadata types used to annotate memory accesses with information helpful
for optimizations are prefixed with ``llvm.mem``.

'``llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access``' Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a loop to be parallel, in addition to using
the ``llvm.loop`` metadata to mark the loop latch branch instruction,
also all of the memory accessing instructions in the loop body need to be
marked with the ``llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access`` metadata. If there
is at least one memory accessing instruction not marked with the metadata,
the loop must be considered a sequential loop. This causes parallel loops to be
converted to sequential loops due to optimization passes that are unaware of
the parallel semantics and that insert new memory instructions to the loop
body.

Example of a loop that is considered parallel due to its correct use of
both ``llvm.loop`` and ``llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access``
metadata types that refer to the same loop identifier metadata.

.. code-block:: llvm

   for.body:
     ...
     %0 = load i32* %arrayidx, align 4, !llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access !0
     ...
     store i32 %0, i32* %arrayidx4, align 4, !llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access !0
     ...
     br i1 %exitcond, label %for.end, label %for.body, !llvm.loop !0

   for.end:
   ...
   !0 = metadata !{ metadata !0 }

It is also possible to have nested parallel loops. In that case the
memory accesses refer to a list of loop identifier metadata nodes instead of
the loop identifier metadata node directly:

.. code-block:: llvm

   outer.for.body:
   ...

   inner.for.body:
     ...
     %0 = load i32* %arrayidx, align 4, !llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access !0
     ...
     store i32 %0, i32* %arrayidx4, align 4, !llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access !0
     ...
     br i1 %exitcond, label %inner.for.end, label %inner.for.body, !llvm.loop !1

   inner.for.end:
     ...
     %0 = load i32* %arrayidx, align 4, !llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access !0
     ...
     store i32 %0, i32* %arrayidx4, align 4, !llvm.mem.parallel_loop_access !0
     ...
     br i1 %exitcond, label %outer.for.end, label %outer.for.body, !llvm.loop !2

   outer.for.end:                                          ; preds = %for.body
   ...
   !0 = metadata !{ metadata !1, metadata !2 } ; a list of loop identifiers
   !1 = metadata !{ metadata !1 } ; an identifier for the inner loop
   !2 = metadata !{ metadata !2 } ; an identifier for the outer loop

'``llvm.vectorizer``'
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Metadata prefixed with ``llvm.vectorizer`` is used to control per-loop
vectorization parameters such as vectorization factor and unroll factor.

``llvm.vectorizer`` metadata should be used in conjunction with ``llvm.loop``
loop identification metadata.

'``llvm.vectorizer.unroll``' Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This metadata instructs the loop vectorizer to unroll the specified
loop exactly ``N`` times.

The first operand is the string ``llvm.vectorizer.unroll`` and the second
operand is an integer specifying the unroll factor. For example:

.. code-block:: llvm

   !0 = metadata !{ metadata !"llvm.vectorizer.unroll", i32 4 }

Note that setting ``llvm.vectorizer.unroll`` to 1 disables unrolling of the
loop.

If ``llvm.vectorizer.unroll`` is set to 0 then the amount of unrolling will be
determined automatically.

'``llvm.vectorizer.width``' Metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This metadata sets the target width of the vectorizer to ``N``. Without
this metadata, the vectorizer will choose a width automatically.
Regardless of this metadata, the vectorizer will only vectorize loops if
it believes it is valid to do so.

The first operand is the string ``llvm.vectorizer.width`` and the second
operand is an integer specifying the width. For example:

.. code-block:: llvm

   !0 = metadata !{ metadata !"llvm.vectorizer.width", i32 4 }

Note that setting ``llvm.vectorizer.width`` to 1 disables vectorization of the
loop.

If ``llvm.vectorizer.width`` is set to 0 then the width will be determined
automatically.

Module Flags Metadata
=====================

Information about the module as a whole is difficult to convey to LLVM's
subsystems. The LLVM IR isn't sufficient to transmit this information.
The ``llvm.module.flags`` named metadata exists in order to facilitate
this. These flags are in the form of key / value pairs --- much like a
dictionary --- making it easy for any subsystem who cares about a flag to
look it up.

The ``llvm.module.flags`` metadata contains a list of metadata triplets.
Each triplet has the following form:

-  The first element is a *behavior* flag, which specifies the behavior
   when two (or more) modules are merged together, and it encounters two
   (or more) metadata with the same ID. The supported behaviors are
   described below.
-  The second element is a metadata string that is a unique ID for the
   metadata. Each module may only have one flag entry for each unique ID (not
   including entries with the **Require** behavior).
-  The third element is the value of the flag.

When two (or more) modules are merged together, the resulting
``llvm.module.flags`` metadata is the union of the modules' flags. That is, for
each unique metadata ID string, there will be exactly one entry in the merged
modules ``llvm.module.flags`` metadata table, and the value for that entry will
be determined by the merge behavior flag, as described below. The only exception
is that entries with the *Require* behavior are always preserved.

The following behaviors are supported:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 90

   * - Value
     - Behavior

   * - 1
     - **Error**
           Emits an error if two values disagree, otherwise the resulting value
           is that of the operands.

   * - 2
     - **Warning**
           Emits a warning if two values disagree. The result value will be the
           operand for the flag from the first module being linked.

   * - 3
     - **Require**
           Adds a requirement that another module flag be present and have a
           specified value after linking is performed. The value must be a
           metadata pair, where the first element of the pair is the ID of the
           module flag to be restricted, and the second element of the pair is
           the value the module flag should be restricted to. This behavior can
           be used to restrict the allowable results (via triggering of an
           error) of linking IDs with the **Override** behavior.

   * - 4
     - **Override**
           Uses the specified value, regardless of the behavior or value of the
           other module. If both modules specify **Override**, but the values
           differ, an error will be emitted.

   * - 5
     - **Append**
           Appends the two values, which are required to be metadata nodes.

   * - 6
     - **AppendUnique**
           Appends the two values, which are required to be metadata
           nodes. However, duplicate entries in the second list are dropped
           during the append operation.

It is an error for a particular unique flag ID to have multiple behaviors,
except in the case of **Require** (which adds restrictions on another metadata
value) or **Override**.

An example of module flags:

.. code-block:: llvm

    !0 = metadata !{ i32 1, metadata !"foo", i32 1 }
    !1 = metadata !{ i32 4, metadata !"bar", i32 37 }
    !2 = metadata !{ i32 2, metadata !"qux", i32 42 }
    !3 = metadata !{ i32 3, metadata !"qux",
      metadata !{
        metadata !"foo", i32 1
      }
    }
    !llvm.module.flags = !{ !0, !1, !2, !3 }

-  Metadata ``!0`` has the ID ``!"foo"`` and the value '1'. The behavior
   if two or more ``!"foo"`` flags are seen is to emit an error if their
   values are not equal.

-  Metadata ``!1`` has the ID ``!"bar"`` and the value '37'. The
   behavior if two or more ``!"bar"`` flags are seen is to use the value
   '37'.

-  Metadata ``!2`` has the ID ``!"qux"`` and the value '42'. The
   behavior if two or more ``!"qux"`` flags are seen is to emit a
   warning if their values are not equal.

-  Metadata ``!3`` has the ID ``!"qux"`` and the value:

   ::

       metadata !{ metadata !"foo", i32 1 }

   The behavior is to emit an error if the ``llvm.module.flags`` does not
   contain a flag with the ID ``!"foo"`` that has the value '1' after linking is
   performed.

Objective-C Garbage Collection Module Flags Metadata
----------------------------------------------------

On the Mach-O platform, Objective-C stores metadata about garbage
collection in a special section called "image info". The metadata
consists of a version number and a bitmask specifying what types of
garbage collection are supported (if any) by the file. If two or more
modules are linked together their garbage collection metadata needs to
be merged rather than appended together.

The Objective-C garbage collection module flags metadata consists of the
following key-value pairs:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Key
     - Value

   * - ``Objective-C Version``
     - **[Required]** --- The Objective-C ABI version. Valid values are 1 and 2.

   * - ``Objective-C Image Info Version``
     - **[Required]** --- The version of the image info section. Currently
       always 0.

   * - ``Objective-C Image Info Section``
     - **[Required]** --- The section to place the metadata. Valid values are
       ``"__OBJC, __image_info, regular"`` for Objective-C ABI version 1, and
       ``"__DATA,__objc_imageinfo, regular, no_dead_strip"`` for
       Objective-C ABI version 2.

   * - ``Objective-C Garbage Collection``
     - **[Required]** --- Specifies whether garbage collection is supported or
       not. Valid values are 0, for no garbage collection, and 2, for garbage
       collection supported.

   * - ``Objective-C GC Only``
     - **[Optional]** --- Specifies that only garbage collection is supported.
       If present, its value must be 6. This flag requires that the
       ``Objective-C Garbage Collection`` flag have the value 2.

Some important flag interactions:

-  If a module with ``Objective-C Garbage Collection`` set to 0 is
   merged with a module with ``Objective-C Garbage Collection`` set to
   2, then the resulting module has the
   ``Objective-C Garbage Collection`` flag set to 0.
-  A module with ``Objective-C Garbage Collection`` set to 0 cannot be
   merged with a module with ``Objective-C GC Only`` set to 6.

Automatic Linker Flags Module Flags Metadata
--------------------------------------------

Some targets support embedding flags to the linker inside individual object
files. Typically this is used in conjunction with language extensions which
allow source files to explicitly declare the libraries they depend on, and have
these automatically be transmitted to the linker via object files.

These flags are encoded in the IR using metadata in the module flags section,
using the ``Linker Options`` key. The merge behavior for this flag is required
to be ``AppendUnique``, and the value for the key is expected to be a metadata
node which should be a list of other metadata nodes, each of which should be a
list of metadata strings defining linker options.

For example, the following metadata section specifies two separate sets of
linker options, presumably to link against ``libz`` and the ``Cocoa``
framework::

    !0 = metadata !{ i32 6, metadata !"Linker Options",
       metadata !{
          metadata !{ metadata !"-lz" },
          metadata !{ metadata !"-framework", metadata !"Cocoa" } } }
    !llvm.module.flags = !{ !0 }

The metadata encoding as lists of lists of options, as opposed to a collapsed
list of options, is chosen so that the IR encoding can use multiple option
strings to specify e.g., a single library, while still having that specifier be
preserved as an atomic element that can be recognized by a target specific
assembly writer or object file emitter.

Each individual option is required to be either a valid option for the target's
linker, or an option that is reserved by the target specific assembly writer or
object file emitter. No other aspect of these options is defined by the IR.

.. _intrinsicglobalvariables:

Intrinsic Global Variables
==========================

LLVM has a number of "magic" global variables that contain data that
affect code generation or other IR semantics. These are documented here.
All globals of this sort should have a section specified as
"``llvm.metadata``". This section and all globals that start with
"``llvm.``" are reserved for use by LLVM.

.. _gv_llvmused:

The '``llvm.used``' Global Variable
-----------------------------------

The ``@llvm.used`` global is an array which has
:ref:`appending linkage <linkage_appending>`. This array contains a list of
pointers to named global variables, functions and aliases which may optionally
have a pointer cast formed of bitcast or getelementptr. For example, a legal
use of it is:

.. code-block:: llvm

    @X = global i8 4
    @Y = global i32 123

    @llvm.used = appending global [2 x i8*] [
       i8* @X,
       i8* bitcast (i32* @Y to i8*)
    ], section "llvm.metadata"

If a symbol appears in the ``@llvm.used`` list, then the compiler, assembler,
and linker are required to treat the symbol as if there is a reference to the
symbol that it cannot see (which is why they have to be named). For example, if
a variable has internal linkage and no references other than that from the
``@llvm.used`` list, it cannot be deleted. This is commonly used to represent
references from inline asms and other things the compiler cannot "see", and
corresponds to "``attribute((used))``" in GNU C.

On some targets, the code generator must emit a directive to the
assembler or object file to prevent the assembler and linker from
molesting the symbol.

.. _gv_llvmcompilerused:

The '``llvm.compiler.used``' Global Variable
--------------------------------------------

The ``@llvm.compiler.used`` directive is the same as the ``@llvm.used``
directive, except that it only prevents the compiler from touching the
symbol. On targets that support it, this allows an intelligent linker to
optimize references to the symbol without being impeded as it would be
by ``@llvm.used``.

This is a rare construct that should only be used in rare circumstances,
and should not be exposed to source languages.

.. _gv_llvmglobalctors:

The '``llvm.global_ctors``' Global Variable
-------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: llvm

    %0 = type { i32, void ()* }
    @llvm.global_ctors = appending global [1 x %0] [%0 { i32 65535, void ()* @ctor }]

The ``@llvm.global_ctors`` array contains a list of constructor
functions and associated priorities. The functions referenced by this
array will be called in ascending order of priority (i.e. lowest first)
when the module is loaded. The order of functions with the same priority
is not defined.

.. _llvmglobaldtors:

The '``llvm.global_dtors``' Global Variable
-------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: llvm

    %0 = type { i32, void ()* }
    @llvm.global_dtors = appending global [1 x %0] [%0 { i32 65535, void ()* @dtor }]

The ``@llvm.global_dtors`` array contains a list of destructor functions
and associated priorities. The functions referenced by this array will
be called in descending order of priority (i.e. highest first) when the
module is loaded. The order of functions with the same priority is not
defined.

Instruction Reference
=====================

The LLVM instruction set consists of several different classifications
of instructions: :ref:`terminator instructions <terminators>`, :ref:`binary
instructions <binaryops>`, :ref:`bitwise binary
instructions <bitwiseops>`, :ref:`memory instructions <memoryops>`, and
:ref:`other instructions <otherops>`.

.. _terminators:

Terminator Instructions
-----------------------

As mentioned :ref:`previously <functionstructure>`, every basic block in a
program ends with a "Terminator" instruction, which indicates which
block should be executed after the current block is finished. These
terminator instructions typically yield a '``void``' value: they produce
control flow, not values (the one exception being the
':ref:`invoke <i_invoke>`' instruction).

The terminator instructions are: ':ref:`ret <i_ret>`',
':ref:`br <i_br>`', ':ref:`switch <i_switch>`',
':ref:`indirectbr <i_indirectbr>`', ':ref:`invoke <i_invoke>`',
':ref:`resume <i_resume>`', and ':ref:`unreachable <i_unreachable>`'.

.. _i_ret:

'``ret``' Instruction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Syntax:
"""""""

::

      ret <type> <value>       ; Return a value from a non-void function
      ret void                 ; Return from void function

Overview:
"""""""""

The '``ret``' instruction is used to return control flow (and optionally
a value) from a function back to the caller.

There are two forms of the '``ret``' instruction: one that returns a
value and then causes control flow, and one that just causes control
flow to occur.

Arguments:
""""""""""

The '``ret``' instruction optionally accepts a single argument, the
return value. The type of the return value must be a ':ref:`first
class <t_firstclass>`' type.

A function is not :ref:`well formed <wellformed>` if it it has a non-void
return type and contains a '``ret``' instruction with no return value or
a return value with a type that does not match its type, or if it has a
void return type and contains a '``ret``' instruction with a return
value.

Semantics:
""""""""""

When the '``ret``' instruction is executed, control flow returns back to
the calling function's context. If the caller is a
":ref:`call <i_call>`" instruction, execution continues at the
instruction after the call. If the caller was an
":ref:`invoke <i_invoke>`" instruction, execution continues at the
beginning of the "normal" destination block. If the instruction returns
a value, that value shall set the call or invoke instruction's return
value.

Example:
""""""""

.. code-block:: llvm

      ret i32 5                       ; Return an integer value of 5
      ret void                        ; Return from a void function
      ret { i32, i8 } { i32 4, i8 2 } ; Return a struct of values 4 and 2

.. _i_br:

'``br``' Instruction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Syntax:
"""""""

::

      br i1 <cond>, label <iftrue>, label <iffalse>
      br label <dest>          ; Unconditional branch

Overview:
"""""""""

The '``br``' instruction is used to cause control flow to transfer to a
different basic block in the current function. There are two forms of
this instruction, corresponding to a conditional branch and an
unconditional branch.

Arguments:
""""""""""

The conditional branch form of the '``br``' instruction takes a single
'``i1``' value and two '``label``' values. The unconditional form of the
'``br``' instruction takes a single '``label``' value as a target.

Semantics:
""""""""""

Upon execution of a conditional '``br``' instruction, the '``i1``'
argument is evaluated. If the value is ``true``, control flows to the
'``iftrue``' ``label`` argument. If "cond" is ``false``, control flows
to the '``iffalse``' ``label`` argument.

Example:
""""""""

.. code-block:: llvm

    Test:
      %cond = icmp eq i32 %a, %b
      br i1 %cond, label %IfEqual, label %IfUnequal
    IfEqual:
      ret i32 1
    IfUnequal:
      ret i32 0

.. _i_switch:

'``switch``' Instruction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Syntax:
"""""""

::

      switch <intty> <value>, label <defaultdest> [ <intty> <val>, label <dest> ... ]

Overview:
"""""""""

The '``switch``' instruction is used to transfer control flow to one of
several different places. It is a generalization of the '``br``'
instruction, allowing a branch to occur to one of many possible
destinations.

Arguments:
""""""""""

The '``switch``' instruction uses three parameters: an integer
comparison value '``value``', a default '``label``' destination, and an
array of pairs of comparison value constants and '``label``'s. The table
is not allowed to contain duplicate constant entries.

Semantics:
""""""""""

The ``switch`` instruction specifies a table of values and destinations.
When the '``switch``' instruction is executed, this table is searched
for the given value. If the value is found, control flow is transferred
to the corresponding destination; otherwise, control flow is transferred
to the default destination.

Implementation:
"""""""""""""""

Depending on properties of the target machine and the particular
``switch`` instruction, this instruction may be code generated in
different ways. For example, it could be generated as a series of
chained conditional branches or with a lookup table.

Example:

Syntax:
"""""""

::

Overview:
"""""""""

The '``indirectbr``' instruction implements an indirect branch to a

"``address``". Address must be derived from a
:ref:`blockaddress <blockaddress>` constant.

Arguments:

The '``address``' argument is the address of the label to jump to. The
rest of the arguments indicate the full set of possible destinations
that the address may point to. Blocks are allowed to occur multiple
times in the destination list, though this isn't particularly useful.

This destination list is required so that dataflow analysis has an
accurate understanding of the CFG.

Semantics:
""""""""""

Control transfers to the block specified in the address argument. All
possible destination blocks must be listed in the label list, otherwise
this instruction has undefined behavior. This implies that jumps to
labels defined in other functions have undefined behavior as well.

Implementation:

This is typically implemented with a jump through a register.

Overview:
"""""""""

The '``invoke``' instruction causes control to transfer to a specified
function, with the possibility of control flow transfer to either the
'``normal``' label or the '``exception``' label. If the callee function
returns with the "``ret``" instruction, control flow will return to the
"normal" label. If the callee (or any indirect callees) returns via the
":ref:`resume <i_resume>`" instruction or other exception handling
mechanism, control is interrupted and continued at the dynamically
nearest "exception" label.

The '``exception``' label is a `landing
pad <ExceptionHandling.html#overview>`_ for the exception. As such,
'``exception``' label is required to have the
":ref:`landingpad <i_landingpad>`" instruction, which contains the
information about the behavior of the program after unwinding happens,
as its first non-PHI instruction. The restrictions on the
"``landingpad``" instruction's tightly couples it to the "``invoke``"
instruction, so that the important information contained within the
"``landingpad``" instruction can't be lost through normal code motion.

Arguments:

#. The optional :ref:`Parameter Attributes <paramattrs>` list for return
   values. Only '``zeroext``', '``signext``', and '``inreg``' attributes
   are valid here.
#. '``ptr to function ty``': shall be the signature of the pointer to
   function value being invoked. In most cases, this is a direct
   function invocation, but indirect ``invoke``'s are just as possible,
   branching off an arbitrary pointer to function value.
#. '``function ptr val``': An LLVM value containing a pointer to a
   function to be invoked.
#. '``function args``': argument list whose types match the function
   signature argument types and parameter attributes. All arguments must
   be of :ref:`first class <t_firstclass>` type. If the function signature
   indicates the function accepts a variable number of arguments, the
   extra arguments can be specified.
#. '``normal label``': the label reached when the called function
   executes a '``ret``' instruction.
#. '``exception label``': the label reached when a callee returns via
   the :ref:`resume <i_resume>` instruction or other exception handling
   mechanism.

   '``noreturn``', '``nounwind``', '``readonly``' and '``readnone``'
   attributes are valid here.

Semantics:
""""""""""

This instruction is designed to operate as a standard '``call``'
instruction in most regards. The primary difference is that it
establishes an association with a label, which is used by the runtime
library to unwind the stack.

This instruction is used in languages with destructors to ensure that
proper cleanup is performed in the case of either a ``longjmp`` or a
thrown exception. Additionally, this is important for implementation of
'``catch``' clauses in high-level languages that support them.

For the purposes of the SSA form, the definition of the value returned
by the '``invoke``' instruction is deemed to occur on the edge from the
current block to the "normal" label. If the callee unwinds then no
return value is available.

Binary Operations
-----------------

Binary operators are used to do most of the computation in a program.
They require two operands of the same type, execute an operation on
them, and produce a single value. The operands might represent multiple
data, as is the case with the :ref:`vector <t_vector>` data type. The
result value has the same type as its operands.

There are several different binary operators:

Vector Operations
-----------------

LLVM supports several instructions to represent vector operations in a
target-independent manner. These instructions cover the element-access
and vector-specific operations needed to process vectors effectively.
While LLVM does directly support these vector operations, many
sophisticated algorithms will want to use target-specific intrinsics to
take full advantage of a specific target.

.. _memoryops:

Memory Access and Addressing Operations
---------------------------------------

A key design point of an SSA-based representation is how it represents
memory. In LLVM, no memory locations are in SSA form, which makes things
very simple. This section describes how to read, write, and allocate
memory in LLVM.

.. _i_alloca:

'``alloca``' Instruction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Syntax:

Overview:
"""""""""

The '``alloca``' instruction allocates memory on the stack frame of the
currently executing function, to be automatically released when this
function returns to its caller. The object is always allocated in the
generic address space (address space zero).

Arguments:
""""""""""

The '``alloca``' instruction allocates ``sizeof(<type>)*NumElements``
bytes of memory on the runtime stack, returning a pointer of the
appropriate type to the program. If "NumElements" is specified, it is
the number of elements allocated, otherwise "NumElements" is defaulted
to be one. If a constant alignment is specified, the value result of the
allocation is guaranteed to be aligned to at least that boundary. If not
specified, or if zero, the target can choose to align the allocation on
any convenient boundary compatible with the type.

'``type``' may be any sized type.

Semantics:
""""""""""

Memory is allocated; a pointer is returned. The operation is undefined
if there is insufficient stack space for the allocation. '``alloca``'d
memory is automatically released when the function returns. The
'``alloca``' instruction is commonly used to represent automatic
variables that must have an address available. When the function returns
(either with the ``ret`` or ``resume`` instructions), the memory is
reclaimed. Allocating zero bytes is legal, but the result is undefined.
The order in which memory is allocated (ie., which way the stack grows)
is not specified.

Overview:
"""""""""

The '``load``' instruction is used to read from memory.

Arguments:
""""""""""

The argument to the ``load`` instruction specifies the memory address
from which to load. The pointer must point to a :ref:`first
class <t_firstclass>` type. If the ``load`` is marked as ``volatile``,
then the optimizer is not allowed to modify the number or order of
execution of this ``load`` with other :ref:`volatile
operations <volatile>`.

If the ``load`` is marked as ``atomic``, it takes an extra
:ref:`ordering <ordering>` and optional ``singlethread`` argument. The
``release`` and ``acq_rel`` orderings are not valid on ``load``
instructions. Atomic loads produce :ref:`defined <memmodel>` results
when they may see multiple atomic stores. The type of the pointee must
be an integer type whose bit width is a power of two greater than or
equal to eight and less than or equal to a target-specific size limit.
``align`` must be explicitly specified on atomic loads, and the load has
undefined behavior if the alignment is not set to a value which is at
least the size in bytes of the pointee. ``!nontemporal`` does not have
any defined semantics for atomic loads.

The optional constant ``align`` argument specifies the alignment of the
operation (that is, the alignment of the memory address). A value of 0
or an omitted ``align`` argument means that the operation has the ABI
alignment for the target. It is the responsibility of the code emitter
to ensure that the alignment information is correct. Overestimating the
alignment results in undefined behavior. Underestimating the alignment
may produce less efficient code. An alignment of 1 is always safe.

The optional ``!nontemporal`` metadata must reference a single
metadata name ``<index>`` corresponding to a metadata node with one
``i32`` entry of value 1. The existence of the ``!nontemporal``
metadata on the instruction tells the optimizer and code generator
that this load is not expected to be reused in the cache. The code
generator may select special instructions to save cache bandwidth, such
as the ``MOVNT`` instruction on x86.

The optional ``!invariant.load`` metadata must reference a single
metadata name ``<index>`` corresponding to a metadata node with no
entries. The existence of the ``!invariant.load`` metadata on the
instruction tells the optimizer and code generator that this load
address points to memory which does not change value during program
execution. The optimizer may then move this load around, for example, by
hoisting it out of loops using loop invariant code motion.

Semantics:
""""""""""

The location of memory pointed to is loaded. If the value being loaded
is of scalar type then the number of bytes read does not exceed the
minimum number of bytes needed to hold all bits of the type. For
example, loading an ``i24`` reads at most three bytes. When loading a
value of a type like ``i20`` with a size that is not an integral number
of bytes, the result is undefined if the value was not originally
written using a store of the same type.

There are two arguments to the ``store`` instruction: a value to store

the ``<value>`` operand. If the ``store`` is marked as ``volatile``,
then the optimizer is not allowed to modify the number or order of
execution of this ``store`` with other :ref:`volatile

If the ``store`` is marked as ``atomic``, it takes an extra
:ref:`ordering <ordering>` and optional ``singlethread`` argument. The
``acquire`` and ``acq_rel`` orderings aren't valid on ``store``

example, storing an ``i24`` writes at most three bytes. When writing a
value of a type like ``i20`` with a size that is not an integral number
of bytes, it is unspecified what happens to the extra bits that do not
belong to the type, but they will typically be overwritten.

'``fence``' instructions take an :ref:`ordering <ordering>` argument which

``acquire``, ``release``, ``acq_rel``, and ``seq_cst`` orderings.

""""""""""

A fence A which has (at least) ``release`` ordering semantics
*synchronizes with* a fence B with (at least) ``acquire`` ordering
semantics if and only if there exist atomic operations X and Y, both
operating on some atomic object M, such that A is sequenced before X, X
modifies M (either directly or through some side effect of a sequence
headed by X), Y is sequenced before B, and Y observes M. This provides a
*happens-before* dependency between A and B. Rather than an explicit
``fence``, one (but not both) of the atomic operations X or Y might
provide a ``release`` or ``acquire`` (resp.) ordering constraint and
still *synchronize-with* the explicit ``fence`` and establish the
*happens-before* edge.

A ``fence`` which has ``seq_cst`` ordering, in addition to having both
``acquire`` and ``release`` semantics specified above, participates in
the global program order of other ``seq_cst`` operations and/or fences.

There are three arguments to the '``cmpxchg``' instruction: an address

address, and a new value to place at that address if the compared values
are equal. The type of '<cmp>' must be an integer type whose bit width

The optional "``singlethread``" argument declares that the ``cmpxchg``

A successful ``cmpxchg`` is a read-modify-write instruction for the purpose

The '``getelementptr``' instruction is used to get the address of a

address calculation only and does not access memory.

Arguments:
""""""""""

The first argument is always a pointer or a vector of pointers, and
forms the basis of the calculation. The remaining arguments are indices
that indicate which of the elements of the aggregate object are indexed.
The interpretation of each index is dependent on the type being indexed
into. The first index always indexes the pointer value given as the
first argument, the second index indexes a value of the type pointed to
(not necessarily the value directly pointed to, since the first index
can be non-zero), etc. The first type indexed into must be a pointer
value, subsequent types can be arrays, vectors, and structs. Note that
subsequent types being indexed into can never be pointers, since that
would require loading the pointer before continuing calculation.

The type of each index argument depends on the type it is indexing into.
When indexing into a (optionally packed) structure, only ``i32`` integer
**constants** are allowed (when using a vector of indices they must all
be the **same** ``i32`` integer constant). When indexing into an array,
pointer or vector, integers of any width are allowed, and they are not
required to be constant. These integers are treated as signed values
where relevant.

For example, let's consider a C code fragment and how it gets compiled
to LLVM:

    entry:
      %arrayidx = getelementptr inbounds %struct.ST* %s, i64 1, i32 2, i32 1, i64 5, i64 13
      ret i32* %arrayidx
    }

Semantics:
""""""""""

In the example above, the first index is indexing into the
'``%struct.ST*``' type, which is a pointer, yielding a '``%struct.ST``'
= '``{ i32, double, %struct.RT }``' type, a structure. The second index
indexes into the third element of the structure, yielding a
'``%struct.RT``' = '``{ i8 , [10 x [20 x i32]], i8 }``' type, another
structure. The third index indexes into the second element of the
structure, yielding a '``[10 x [20 x i32]]``' type, an array. The two
dimensions of the array are subscripted into, yielding an '``i32``'
type. The '``getelementptr``' instruction returns a pointer to this
element, thus computing a value of '``i32*``' type.

Note that it is perfectly legal to index partially through a structure,
returning a pointer to an inner element. Because of this, the LLVM code
for the given testcase is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: llvm

    define i32* @foo(%struct.ST* %s) {
      %t1 = getelementptr %struct.ST* %s, i32 1                 ; yields %struct.ST*:%t1
      %t2 = getelementptr %struct.ST* %t1, i32 0, i32 2         ; yields %struct.RT*:%t2
      %t3 = getelementptr %struct.RT* %t2, i32 0, i32 1         ; yields [10 x [20 x i32]]*:%t3
      %t4 = getelementptr [10 x [20 x i32]]* %t3, i32 0, i32 5  ; yields [20 x i32]*:%t4
      %t5 = getelementptr [20 x i32]* %t4, i32 0, i32 13        ; yields i32*:%t5
      ret i32* %t5
    }

If the ``inbounds`` keyword is present, the result value of the
``getelementptr`` is a :ref:`poison value <poisonvalues>` if the base
pointer is not an *in bounds* address of an allocated object, or if any
of the addresses that would be formed by successive addition of the
offsets implied by the indices to the base address with infinitely
precise signed arithmetic are not an *in bounds* address of that
allocated object. The *in bounds* addresses for an allocated object are
all the addresses that point into the object, plus the address one byte
past the end. In cases where the base is a vector of pointers the
``inbounds`` keyword applies to each of the computations element-wise.

If the ``inbounds`` keyword is not present, the offsets are added to the
base address with silently-wrapping two's complement arithmetic. If the
offsets have a different width from the pointer, they are sign-extended
or truncated to the width of the pointer. The result value of the
``getelementptr`` may be outside the object pointed to by the base
pointer. The result value may not necessarily be used to access memory
though, even if it happens to point into allocated storage. See the
:ref:`Pointer Aliasing Rules <pointeraliasing>` section for more
information.

The getelementptr instruction is often confusing. For some more insight
into how it works, see :doc:`the getelementptr FAQ <GetElementPtr>`.

Example:
""""""""

.. code-block:: llvm

        ; yields [12 x i8]*:aptr
        %aptr = getelementptr {i32, [12 x i8]}* %saptr, i64 0, i32 1
        ; yields i8*:vptr
        %vptr = getelementptr {i32, <2 x i8>}* %svptr, i64 0, i32 1, i32 1
        ; yields i8*:eptr
        %eptr = getelementptr [12 x i8]* %aptr, i64 0, i32 1
        ; yields i32*:iptr
        %iptr = getelementptr [10 x i32]* @arr, i16 0, i16 0

In cases where the pointer argument is a vector of pointers, each index
must be a vector with the same number of elements. For example:

.. code-block:: llvm

     %A = getelementptr <4 x i8*> %ptrs, <4 x i64> %offsets,

The type of the incoming values is specified with the first type field.

This instruction requires several arguments:

#. The optional "tail" marker indicates that the callee function does
   not access any allocas or varargs in the caller. Note that calls may
   be marked "tail" even if they do not occur before a
   :ref:`ret <i_ret>` instruction. If the "tail" marker is present, the
   function call is eligible for tail call optimization, but `might not
   in fact be optimized into a jump <CodeGenerator.html#tailcallopt>`_.
   The code generator may optimize calls marked "tail" with either 1)
   automatic `sibling call
   optimization <CodeGenerator.html#sibcallopt>`_ when the caller and
   callee have matching signatures, or 2) forced tail call optimization
   when the following extra requirements are met:

   -  Caller and callee both have the calling convention ``fastcc``.
   -  The call is in tail position (ret immediately follows call and ret
      uses value of call or is void).
   -  Option ``-tailcallopt`` is enabled, or
      ``llvm::GuaranteedTailCallOpt`` is ``true``.
   -  `Platform specific constraints are
      met. <CodeGenerator.html#tailcallopt>`_

#. The optional "cconv" marker indicates which :ref:`calling
   convention <callingconv>` the call should use. If none is
   specified, the call defaults to using C calling conventions. The
   calling convention of the call must match the calling convention of
   the target function, or else the behavior is undefined.
#. The optional :ref:`Parameter Attributes <paramattrs>` list for return
   values. Only '``zeroext``', '``signext``', and '``inreg``' attributes
   are valid here.
#. '``ty``': the type of the call instruction itself which is also the
   type of the return value. Functions that return no value are marked
   ``void``.
#. '``fnty``': shall be the signature of the pointer to function value
   being invoked. The argument types must match the types implied by
   this signature. This type can be omitted if the function is not
   varargs and if the function type does not return a pointer to a
   function.
#. '``fnptrval``': An LLVM value containing a pointer to a function to
   be invoked. In most cases, this is a direct function invocation, but
   indirect ``call``'s are just as possible, calling an arbitrary pointer
   to function value.
#. '``function args``': argument list whose types match the function
   signature argument types and parameter attributes. All arguments must
   be of :ref:`first class <t_firstclass>` type. If the function signature
   indicates the function accepts a variable number of arguments, the
   extra arguments can be specified.

llvm treats calls to some functions with names and arguments that match
the standard C99 library as being the C99 library functions, and may
perform optimizations or generate code for them under that assumption.

It is legal for this instruction to be called in a function which does

This instruction takes a ``pers_fn`` value. This is the personality

``cleanup`` flag indicates that the landing pad block is a cleanup.

A ``clause`` begins with the clause type --- ``catch`` or ``filter`` --- and
contains the global variable representing the "type" that may be caught
or filtered respectively. Unlike the ``catch`` clause, the ``filter``
clause takes an array constant as its argument. Use
"``[0 x i8**] undef``" for a filter which cannot throw. The
'``landingpad``' instruction must contain *at least* one ``clause`` or
the ``cleanup`` flag.

Semantics:
""""""""""

The '``landingpad``' instruction defines the values which are set by the
personality function (``pers_fn``) upon re-entry to the function, and
therefore the "result type" of the ``landingpad`` instruction. As with
calling conventions, how the personality function results are
represented in LLVM IR is target specific.

The clauses are applied in order from top to bottom. If two
``landingpad`` instructions are merged together through inlining, the
clauses from the calling function are appended to the list of clauses.
When the call stack is being unwound due to an exception being thrown,
the exception is compared against each ``clause`` in turn. If it doesn't
match any of the clauses, and the ``cleanup`` flag is not set, then
unwinding continues further up the call stack.

The ``landingpad`` instruction has several restrictions:

-  A landing pad block is a basic block which is the unwind destination
   of an '``invoke``' instruction.
-  A landing pad block must have a '``landingpad``' instruction as its
   first non-PHI instruction.
-  There can be only one '``landingpad``' instruction within the landing
   pad block.
-  A basic block that is not a landing pad block may not include a
   '``landingpad``' instruction.
-  All '``landingpad``' instructions in a function must have the same
   personality function.

Example:

.. _intrinsics:

Intrinsic Functions
===================

LLVM supports the notion of an "intrinsic function". These functions
have well known names and semantics and are required to follow certain
restrictions. Overall, these intrinsics represent an extension mechanism
for the LLVM language that does not require changing all of the
transformations in LLVM when adding to the language (or the bitcode
reader/writer, the parser, etc...).

Intrinsic function names must all start with an "``llvm.``" prefix. This
prefix is reserved in LLVM for intrinsic names; thus, function names may
not begin with this prefix. Intrinsic functions must always be external
functions: you cannot define the body of intrinsic functions. Intrinsic
functions may only be used in call or invoke instructions: it is illegal
to take the address of an intrinsic function. Additionally, because
intrinsic functions are part of the LLVM language, it is required if any
are added that they be documented here.

Some intrinsic functions can be overloaded, i.e., the intrinsic
represents a family of functions that perform the same operation but on
different data types. Because LLVM can represent over 8 million
different integer types, overloading is used commonly to allow an
intrinsic function to operate on any integer type. One or more of the
argument types or the result type can be overloaded to accept any
integer type. Argument types may also be defined as exactly matching a
previous argument's type or the result type. This allows an intrinsic
function which accepts multiple arguments, but needs all of them to be
of the same type, to only be overloaded with respect to a single
argument or the result.

Overloaded intrinsics will have the names of its overloaded argument
types encoded into its function name, each preceded by a period. Only
those types which are overloaded result in a name suffix. Arguments
whose type is matched against another type do not. For example, the
``llvm.ctpop`` function can take an integer of any width and returns an
integer of exactly the same integer width. This leads to a family of
functions such as ``i8 @llvm.ctpop.i8(i8 %val)`` and
``i29 @llvm.ctpop.i29(i29 %val)``. Only one type, the return type, is
overloaded, and only one type suffix is required. Because the argument's
type is matched against the return type, it does not require its own
name suffix.

To learn how to add an intrinsic function, please see the `Extending
LLVM Guide <ExtendingLLVM.html>`_.

.. _int_varargs:

Variable Argument Handling Intrinsics
-------------------------------------

Variable argument support is defined in LLVM with the
:ref:`va_arg <i_va_arg>` instruction and these three intrinsic
functions. These functions are related to the similarly named macros
defined in the ``<stdarg.h>`` header file.

All of these functions operate on arguments that use a target-specific
value type "``va_list``". The LLVM assembly language reference manual
does not define what this type is, so all transformations should be
prepared to handle these functions regardless of the type used.

This example shows how the :ref:`va_arg <i_va_arg>` instruction and the
variable argument handling intrinsic functions are used.

.. _int_stacksave:

'``llvm.stacksave``' Intrinsic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Syntax:
"""""""

::

      declare i8* @llvm.stacksave()

Overview:
"""""""""

The '``llvm.stacksave``' intrinsic is used to remember the current state
of the function stack, for use with
:ref:`llvm.stackrestore <int_stackrestore>`. This is useful for
implementing language features like scoped automatic variable sized
arrays in C99.

Semantics:
""""""""""

This intrinsic returns a opaque pointer value that can be passed to
:ref:`llvm.stackrestore <int_stackrestore>`. When an
``llvm.stackrestore`` intrinsic is executed with a value saved from
``llvm.stacksave``, it effectively restores the state of the stack to
the state it was in when the ``llvm.stacksave`` intrinsic executed. In
practice, this pops any :ref:`alloca <i_alloca>` blocks from the stack that
were allocated after the ``llvm.stacksave`` was executed.

::

Overview:
"""""""""

The '``llvm.prefetch``' intrinsic is a hint to the code generator to
insert a prefetch instruction if supported; otherwise, it is a noop.
Prefetches have no effect on the behavior of the program but can change
its performance characteristics.

Arguments:
""""""""""

``address`` is the address to be prefetched, ``rw`` is the specifier
determining if the fetch should be for a read (0) or write (1), and
``locality`` is a temporal locality specifier ranging from (0) - no
locality, to (3) - extremely local keep in cache. The ``cache type``
specifies whether the prefetch is performed on the data (1) or
instruction (0) cache. The ``rw``, ``locality`` and ``cache type``
arguments must be constant integers.

Semantics:
""""""""""

This intrinsic does not modify the behavior of the program. In
particular, prefetches cannot trap and do not produce a value. On
targets that support this intrinsic, the prefetch can provide hints to
the processor cache for better performance.

'``llvm.pcmarker``' Intrinsic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Syntax:
"""""""

::

      declare void @llvm.pcmarker(i32 <id>)

Overview:
"""""""""

The '``llvm.pcmarker``' intrinsic is a method to export a Program
Counter (PC) in a region of code to simulators and other tools. The
method is target specific, but it is expected that the marker will use
exported symbols to transmit the PC of the marker. The marker makes no
guarantees that it will remain with any specific instruction after
optimizations. It is possible that the presence of a marker will inhibit
optimizations. The intended use is to be inserted after optimizations to
allow correlations of simulation runs.

Arguments:

``id`` is a numerical id identifying the marker.

This intrinsic does not modify the behavior of the program. Backends
that do not support this intrinsic may ignore it.

'``llvm.readcyclecounter``' Intrinsic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Syntax:
"""""""

::

Overview:
"""""""""

The '``llvm.readcyclecounter``' intrinsic provides access to the cycle
counter register (or similar low latency, high accuracy clocks) on those
targets that support it. On X86, it should map to RDTSC. On Alpha, it
should map to RPCC. As the backing counters overflow quickly (on the
order of 9 seconds on alpha), this should only be used for small
timings.

Semantics:
""""""""""

When directly supported, reading the cycle counter should not modify any
memory. Implementations are allowed to either return a application
specific value or a system wide value. On backends without support, this
is lowered to a constant 0.

Note that runtime support may be conditional on the privilege-level code is
running at and the host platform.

Standard C Library Intrinsics

LLVM provides intrinsics for a few important standard C library
functions. These intrinsics allow source-language front-ends to pass
information about the alignment of the pointer arguments to the code
generator, providing opportunity for more efficient code generation.

Bit Manipulation Intrinsics

The '``llvm.bswap``' family of intrinsics is used to byte swap integer

The ``llvm.bswap.i16`` intrinsic returns an i16 value that has the high

swapped, so that if the input bytes are numbered 0, 1, 2, 3 then the
returned i32 will have its bytes in 3, 2, 1, 0 order. The
``llvm.bswap.i48``, ``llvm.bswap.i64`` and other intrinsics extend this

Half Precision Floating Point Intrinsics
----------------------------------------

For most target platforms, half precision floating point is a
storage-only format. This means that it is a dense encoding (in memory)
but does not support computation in the format.

This means that code must first load the half-precision floating point
value as an i16, then convert it to float with
:ref:`llvm.convert.from.fp16 <int_convert_from_fp16>`. Computation can
then be performed on the float value (including extending to double
etc). To store the value back to memory, it is first converted to float
if needed, then converted to i16 with
:ref:`llvm.convert.to.fp16 <int_convert_to_fp16>`, then storing as an
i16 value.

.. _int_trampoline:

Trampoline Intrinsics
---------------------

These intrinsics make it possible to excise one parameter, marked with
the :ref:`nest <nest>` attribute, from a function. The result is a
callable function pointer lacking the nest parameter - the caller does
not need to provide a value for it. Instead, the value to use is stored
in advance in a "trampoline", a block of memory usually allocated on the
stack, which also contains code to splice the nest value into the
argument list. This is used to implement the GCC nested function address
extension.

For example, if the function is ``i32 f(i8* nest %c, i32 %x, i32 %y)``
then the resulting function pointer has signature ``i32 (i32, i32)*``.
It can be created as follows:

.. code-block:: llvm

      %tramp = alloca [10 x i8], align 4 ; size and alignment only correct for X86
      %tramp1 = getelementptr [10 x i8]* %tramp, i32 0, i32 0
      call i8* @llvm.init.trampoline(i8* %tramp1, i8* bitcast (i32 (i8*, i32, i32)* @f to i8*), i8* %nval)
      %p = call i8* @llvm.adjust.trampoline(i8* %tramp1)
      %fp = bitcast i8* %p to i32 (i32, i32)*

The call ``%val = call i32 %fp(i32 %x, i32 %y)`` is then equivalent to
``%val = call i32 %f(i8* %nval, i32 %x, i32 %y)``.

front-end that generates this intrinsic needs to have some
target-specific knowledge. The ``func`` argument must hold a function
bitcast to an ``i8*``.

Semantics:
""""""""""

The block of memory pointed to by ``tramp`` is filled with target
dependent code, turning it into a function. Then ``tramp`` needs to be
passed to :ref:`llvm.adjust.trampoline <int_at>` to get a pointer which can
be :ref:`bitcast (to a new function) and called <int_trampoline>`. The new
function's signature is the same as that of ``func`` with any arguments
marked with the ``nest`` attribute removed. At most one such ``nest``
argument is allowed, and it must be of pointer type. Calling the new
function is equivalent to calling ``func`` with the same argument list,
but with ``nval`` used for the missing ``nest`` argument. If, after
calling ``llvm.init.trampoline``, the memory pointed to by ``tramp`` is
modified, then the effect of any later call to the returned function
pointer is undefined.

'``llvm.adjust.trampoline``' Intrinsic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Syntax:
"""""""

::

      declare i8* @llvm.adjust.trampoline(i8* <tramp>)

Overview:
"""""""""

This performs any required machine-specific adjustment to the address of
a trampoline (passed as ``tramp``).

Arguments:
""""""""""

``tramp`` must point to a block of memory which already has trampoline
code filled in by a previous call to
:ref:`llvm.init.trampoline <int_it>`.

Semantics:
""""""""""

On some architectures the address of the code to be executed needs to be
different to the address where the trampoline is actually stored. This
intrinsic returns the executable address corresponding to ``tramp``
after performing the required machine specific adjustments. The pointer
returned can then be :ref:`bitcast and executed <int_trampoline>`.

Memory Use Markers
------------------

This class of intrinsics exists to information about the lifetime of
memory objects and ranges where variables are immutable.

'``llvm.lifetime.start``' Intrinsic

This intrinsic indicates that before this point in the code, the value
of the memory pointed to by ``ptr`` is dead. This means that it is known
to never be used and has an undefined value. A load from the pointer

The first argument is a constant integer representing the size of the
object, or -1 if it is variable sized. The second argument is a pointer
to the object.

Semantics:

This intrinsic indicates that after this point in the code, the value of
the memory pointed to by ``ptr`` is dead. This means that it is known to
never be used and has an undefined value. Any stores into the memory
object following this intrinsic may be removed as dead.

'``llvm.invariant.start``' Intrinsic

General Intrinsics
------------------

This class of intrinsics is designed to be generic and has no specific
purpose.

'``llvm.var.annotation``' Intrinsic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This intrinsic is lowered to the target dependent trap instruction. If
the target does not have a trap instruction, this intrinsic will be
lowered to a call of the ``abort()`` function.

'``llvm.debugtrap``' Intrinsic

The ``llvm.stackprotector`` intrinsic takes the ``guard`` and stores it
onto the stack at ``slot``. The stack slot is adjusted to ensure that it
is placed on the stack before local variables.

Arguments:
""""""""""

The ``llvm.stackprotector`` intrinsic requires two pointer arguments.
The first argument is the value loaded from the stack guard
``@__stack_chk_guard``. The second variable is an ``alloca`` that has
enough space to hold the value of the guard.

Semantics:
""""""""""

This intrinsic causes the prologue/epilogue inserter to force the
position of the ``AllocaInst`` stack slot to be before local variables
on the stack. This is to ensure that if a local variable on the stack is
overwritten, it will destroy the value of the guard. When the function
exits, the guard on the stack is checked against the original guard. If
they are different, then the program aborts by calling the
``__stack_chk_fail()`` function.

Overview:
"""""""""

The ``llvm.objectsize`` intrinsic is designed to provide information to
the optimizers to determine at compile time whether a) an operation
(like memcpy) will overflow a buffer that corresponds to an object, or
b) that a runtime check for overflow isn't necessary. An object in this
context means an allocation of a specific class, structure, array, or
other object.

Arguments:
""""""""""

The ``llvm.objectsize`` intrinsic takes two arguments. The first
argument is a pointer to or into the ``object``. The second argument is
a boolean and determines whether ``llvm.objectsize`` returns 0 (if true)
or -1 (if false) when the object size is unknown. The second argument
only accepts constants.

Semantics:
""""""""""

The ``llvm.objectsize`` intrinsic is lowered to a constant representing
the size of the object concerned. If the size cannot be determined at
compile time, ``llvm.objectsize`` returns ``i32/i64 -1 or 0`` (depending
on the ``min`` argument).
