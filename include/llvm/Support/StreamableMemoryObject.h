/// StreamableMemoryObject - Interface to data which might be streamed.
/// Streamability has 2 important implications/restrictions. First, the data
/// might not yet exist in memory when the request is made. This just means
/// that readByte/readBytes might have to block or do some work to get it.
/// More significantly, the exact size of the object might not be known until
/// it has all been fetched. This means that to return the right result,
/// getExtent must also wait for all the data to arrive; therefore it should
/// not be called on objects which are actually streamed (this would defeat
/// the purpose of streaming). Instead, isValidAddress and isObjectEnd can be
/// used to test addresses without knowing the exact size of the stream.
/// Finally, getPointer can be used instead of readBytes to avoid extra copying.
